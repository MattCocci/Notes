\maketitle 

\begin{enumerate} 

% Question 1
\item \textbf{Exercise 88.5}: $(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ is a positive measure space, and we then define a relative measure space $(E,\mathscr{M}_E,\lambda)$ where $\lambda(A)=\mu(A\cap E)$.

\begin{enumerate}
% Question 1a
\item For $f\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, we want to show that $f|_E \in\mathscr{L}(E,\mathscr{M}_E,\lambda)$ and that
\[
    \int_E f|_E \; d\lambda = \int_X f \Chi_E\; d\mu
\]
First, show that $f|_E$ is $\mathscr{M}_E$ measurable (previous exercise), and then that $f\chi_E$ is $\mathscr{M}$ measurable.

Then show $f|_E \leq f$ for all $E\subset X$, so that $\int_X f|_E \; d\mu$ will be integrable. (Start with nonneg functions, then generalize.) 

Now if we show $\int_E f|_E \; d\lambda$ equals that value, the integral is finite, so the result is achieved.

$(\leq)$ First show that $f\chi_E$ is measurable, and that the integral is finite. Then take any simple function for the $E$ case, unpack it, to get it into $X$ space, then take the sup.

$(\geq)$ Unpack the righthand side, sup the left.

% 1b 
\item Show that $g$ is measurable in $X$ space.  

\end{enumerate}

% Question 2
\item 

\begin{enumerate} 
        

% Question 2a
\item \textbf{Exercise 88.6}: The constant function $M$ is measurable. Since $\mu(X)<\infty$, $g(x)=M$ is integrable. Then we can bound the limit of the integrals, exchange the limit and integral(DTC), so that the integral is finite, so lebesgue integrable.

Here we have that $f$ is bounded by pointwise convergence. Look VERY carefully at DTC to see if I can apply it.

% Question 2b
\item \textbf{Exercise 88.10}: Moving bump from class. Here we have that $f$ is not necessarily bounded, although the $f_n$ are
\end{enumerate}

% Question 7
\item We start with the function $|f|>0$, which is measurable because $f$ is integrable and $|f|$ is a continuous transformation of $f$. We also know that $|f|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ by Theorem 88.12. Now consider the set
\[
    A_1 = |f|^{-1}([t,\infty]) = \{x \;:\; |f(x)|\geq t\}
    \qquad t>0
\]
Next, let $A_2 = X\setminus A_1$. 

We now construct a simple function $s$:
\[
    s = t\cdot \Chi_{A_1} + 0 \cdot \Chi_{A_2}
\]
First, it's obvious that $0\leq s$ because $t>0$. Second, it's obvious that $s\leq |f|$, because we've partitioned the range of $|f|$ into two segments: the parts greater than $t$ (which are mapped from $A_1$) and everything else (which cannot be less than zero).

Now, by the definition of the integral, we have that 
\[
    \int_X |f| \; d\mu = \sup_{0\leq s \leq f} \int_X s\;d\mu
    \qquad\Rightarrow\qquad
    \int_X |f| \; d\mu \geq \int_X s\;d\mu
\]
where the $s$ in the second inequality is the $s$ defined above. So now, let's compute it:
\begin{align*}
    \int_X |f| \; d\mu \geq \int_X s\;d\mu
    &= t \mu(A_1) + 0 \mu(A_2) \\
    &= t \mu(A_1) 
\end{align*}
Rearranging, and substituting in for $A_1$, we see that
\begin{equation}
    \mu\left(\{x \;:\; |f(x)|\geq t\}\right) \leq
    \frac{1}{t}\int_X |f| \; d\mu 
\end{equation}




\end{enumerate}
