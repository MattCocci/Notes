\begin{enumerate} 

% Question 1
\item \textbf{Exercise 88.5}: $(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ is a positive measure space, and we then define a relative measure space $(E,\mathscr{M}_E,\lambda)$ where $\lambda(A)=\mu(A\cap E)$.

\begin{enumerate}
% Question 1a
\item For $f\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, we want to show that $f|_E \in\mathscr{L}(E,\mathscr{M}_E,\lambda)$ and that
\[
    \int_E f|_E \; d\lambda = \int_X f \Chi_E\; d\mu
\]
First, we show that $f|_E$ is $\mathscr{M}_E$ measurable so that the integral of $f|_E$ over $E$ is defined. To do so, consider any set $[a,\infty]$, then take it's preimage
\begin{align*}
    f|_E^{-1}([a,\infty]) &= 
    &=f^{-1}([a,\infty]) \cap E \subset X\\
\end{align*}
And because $f$ is $\mathscr{M}$-measurable, $f^{-1}([a,\infty])\in \mathscr{M}$, which implies 
\[
    f|_E^{-1}([a,\infty]) = 
    f^{-1}([a,\infty]) \cap E \in \mathscr{M}_E
\]
by the definition of the relative measure. 
\\
\\
Next, we just need to show that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q1toeq}
    \int_E f|_E \; d\lambda = \int_X f \Chi_E\; d\mu \quad 
    \text{which implies} \quad f|_E \in\mathscr{L}(E,\mathscr{M}_E,\mu)
\end{equation}
To see why this implication holds, note that we know $f\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, which implies $|f|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$. And since $0\leq|f\Chi_{E}|\leq|f|$, we have a set of integrable, measurable functions bounding $|f\Chi_E|$, so that 
\begin{equation}
    -\infty < \int_X 0\;d\mu \leq \int_X |f\Chi_E| \; d\mu \leq \int_X |f| \; d\mu 
    < \infty 
\end{equation}
So then $|f\Chi_E|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, which implies $f\Chi_E\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ and that both integrals in \ref{q1toeq} are finite.
\\
\\
So start by supposing that $f$ is non-negative, and let $s$ be any simple function on $X$ such that $0\leq s\leq f$. Now we know by the definition of the integral that
\begin{align*}
    \int_X f\Chi_E \; d\mu \geq \sum^n_{i=1} c_i \Chi_E \mu(X_i)
    \quad \text{where $\cup X_i = X$}
\end{align*}
Next, simplify by using $s\Chi_E = 0$ on $E^c$ and decompose $X_i = (E\cap X_i) \cup (E^c\cap X_i)$ so that we can use countable additivity:
\begin{align*}
    \int_X f\Chi_E \; d\mu &\geq \sum^n_{i=1} c_i \Chi_E \mu(X_i) \\
    &\geq \sum^n_{i=1} c_i \Chi_E \mu((E\cap X_i) \cup (E^c\cap X_i)) \\
    &\geq \sum^n_{i=1} c_i \Chi_E \left[\mu(E\cap X_i) +\mu(E^c\cap X_i)\right]  \\
    &\geq \sum^n_{i=1} c_i \Chi_E \mu(E\cap X_i) 
        +\sum^n_{i=1} c_i \Chi_E\mu(E^c\cap X_i)  \\
    &\geq \sum^n_{i=1} c_i \Chi_E \mu(E\cap X_i)  
\end{align*}
But we see that this last expression defines a simple function on $E$, a range of at most $n$ points $\{c_1,\ldots,c_n\}$. Plus, $X_i\cap E$ is a partition of $E$, since the $X_i$ were disjoint already. We can also substitute in $\lambda(X_i)$ for $\mu(E\cap X_i)$, because this is the definition of $\lambda$. So we see
\begin{align*}
    \int_X f\Chi_E \; d\mu 
        &\geq \sum^{n+1}_{i=1} c_i \lambda(X_i)  \\
        &\geq \int_E s|_E \; d\lambda
\end{align*}
Note that $s|_E$ is simple and $\mathscr{M}_E$ measurable by our reasoning above, and $0\leq s|_E\leq f|_E$. Taking the sup over all such simple functions, we get
\begin{align}
    \label{q1.geq1}
    \int_X f\Chi_E \; d\mu 
        &\geq \int_E f|_E \; d\lambda
\end{align}
Now, by similar reasoning, let $s|_E$ be a simple function such that $0\leq s|_E \leq f|_E$. Writing out the integral
\begin{align*}
    \int_E f|_E \; d\lambda
        &\geq \int_E s|_E \; d\lambda 
        = \sum^n_{i=1} c_i \lambda(X_i) 
        \qquad \text{where $\cup X_i=X$} 
\end{align*}
By taking our $X_i$ as measurable sets such that they partition $X$, we can also cover all points in $E$. So simplify the inequality above further:
\begin{align*}
        &\geq \sum^n_{i=1} c_i \mu(X_i \cap E)  \\
        &\geq \sum^n_{i=1} c_i \mu(X_i \cap E)  + 
            \sum^n_{i=1} 0 \mu(X_i \cap E^c)  \\
        &\geq \sum^{n+1}_{i=1} c_i \mu((X_i \cap E) \cup (X_i\cap E^c))  \\
        &\geq \sum^{n+1}_{i=1} c_i \mu(X_i)
\end{align*}
But this is just the integral of a simple function, call it $s$, over $X$. Moreover, we know that this simple function will be such that $0\leq s \leq f\Chi_E$, since it is 0 where $x\in E^c$, by construction, and equals $f$ where $x\in E$. Then taking the sup over all such $s$, we get
\begin{align}
    \label{q1.geq2}
    \int_E f|_E \; d\lambda
        &\geq \int_X f \Chi_E \; d\mu
\end{align}
Together, Inequalities \ref{q1.geq1} and \ref{q1.geq2} imply the desired result.

Finally, this extends to arbitrary (i.e. not necessarily non-negative) measurable functions by dealing with the same definitions and extensions using the always non-negative $f_-$ and $f_+$ that we used to integrate arbitrary $f$ in many of the proofs we saw in class. 

% 1b 
\item Next, we want to show that if $f\in\mathscr{L}(E,\mathscr{M}_E,\mu)$, then
\begin{equation}
    g(x) = \begin{cases} f(x) & x \in E \\ 0 & x\in X\setminus E \end{cases}
\end{equation}
is measurable, in $\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, and such that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q1b}
    \int_X g \; d\mu = \int_X g \Chi_E \; d\mu = \int_E f \; d\lambda
\end{equation}
So let's take each in turn.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  To show that $g$ is $\mathscr{M}$ measurable, write the set 
\[
    A = \{x \; | \; g(x) > a\} = g^{-1}([a,\infty])
\]
We need to show that $A$ is in $\mathscr{M}$. So decompose the set
\begin{align*}
    A = \left(A \cap E) \cup (A\cap E^c)\right)
\end{align*}
Now, we can solve a simpler problem and show that each component in the previous line is in $\mathscr{M}$, in which case their intersection would be too, proving the result.
\\
\\
So start by noting that if $x\in A\cap E$, then $x\in E$, which means $g(x)=f(x)$. And since 

\item We show that $g\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ by showing, in the next part, that 
\[
    \int_X g \; d\mu = \int_E f \; d\lambda
\]
Since we know $f\in\mathscr{L}(E,\mathscr{M}_E,\mu)$, the righthand side of this equality is finite, implying that the lefthand side is finite and $g\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$.   

\item To show (\ref{q1b}), notice that we clearly have $g|_E = f$. Then we can write
\begin{align*}
    \int_E g|_E \; d\lambda  = \int_E f \; d\lambda 
\end{align*}
So the integral of $g|_E$ over $\lambda$ on $E$ is finite. Next, note that we also have
\begin{align*}
    \int_X g \Chi_E \; d\mu &= 
    \int_E g \Chi_E \; d\mu + 
    \int_{X\setminus E} g \Chi_E \; d\mu  \\
    &= \int_E g \Chi_E \; d\lambda + 
    \int_{X\setminus E} g \Chi_E \; d\mu 
\end{align*}
The proof then proceeds in a very similar way as in part (a).


\end{enumerate}


\end{enumerate}

% Question 2
\item In both, we have a positive measure space, $(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, with $\mu(X)<\infty$.

\begin{enumerate} 

% Question 2a
\item \textbf{Exercise 88.6}: We have a sequence of measurable functions $\{f_n\}_1^\infty$ such that $f=\lim f_n$. We also know that the $f_n$ are bounded so that $|f_n(x)|\leq M$ for all $n$ and $x$. 

This setup lends itself nicely to using the Dominated Convergence Theorem.  Specifically, set $g(x)=M$. A constant function is clearly measurable, and because $\mu(X)<\infty$ we know from class and by Theorem 88.4 in the book that $\int_X g \; d\mu$ exists (and is finite) so that $g\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$.

Thus we satisfy the conditions of the Dominated Convergence Theorem because $f_n$ is measurable, $\lim f_n$ exists for all $x$, and $|f_n|\leq g\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$. Thus, 
\[
  \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X f_n \; d\mu  
  = \int_X \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} f_n \; d\mu
  = \int_X  f \; d\mu
\]

% Question 2b
\item \textbf{Exercise 88.10}: For this question, we have a sequence of bounded real measurable functions $\{f_n\}^\infty_1$ on $X$ such that $f_n\rightarrow f$ uniformly. We again want to show that 
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X f_n \; d\mu
    = \int_X f \; d\mu
\end{equation}
    
($\leq$ Direction) First, we know that because $f_n\rightarrow f$ uniformly, $f$ is measurable, so we can integrate. We also know that for any $\varepsilon>0$, we can find an $N$ such that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{stillholds}
    f_n \in (f-\varepsilon, f+\varepsilon) 
    \qquad \text{For all $n>N$ and $x\in X$}
\end{equation}
And so we know that $f-\varepsilon\leq f_N\leq f+\varepsilon$, to which we can apply the monotonicity of the integral
\begin{equation}
    \label{q2.tolim}
    \int_X (f-\varepsilon) \; d\mu\leq
    \int_X f_N \; d\mu \leq \int_X (f+\varepsilon) \; d\mu
\end{equation}
Note, both $f-\varepsilon$ and $f+\varepsilon$ are measurable because they're the difference or sum of two measurable functions: $f$ and a constant, $\varepsilon$. 
\\
\\
Now take the limit of Inequality \ref{q2.tolim} with respect to $N$. 
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{N\rightarrow\infty} \int_X (f-\varepsilon) \; d\mu
    \leq \lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}
    \int_X f_N \; d\mu \leq 
    \lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\int_X (f+\varepsilon) \; d\mu
\end{align*}
The inequality will still hold because Statement (\ref{stillholds}) holds for all $n>N$. And since the outer integrals don't depend upon $N$, we get
\begin{equation}
    \int_X (f-\varepsilon) \; d\mu \leq
    \lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\int_X f_N \; d\mu \leq 
    \int_X (f+\varepsilon) \; d\mu
\end{equation}
But recall $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, and the middle integral no longer depends upon $\varepsilon$, so take the limit as $\varepsilon\rightarrow0$ to get that 
\begin{align*}
    \int_X f \; d\mu \leq
    \lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\int_X f_N \; d\mu &\leq 
    \int_X f \; d\mu \\
    \Rightarrow\qquad
    \lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\int_X f_N \; d\mu &=
    \int_X f \; d\mu 
\end{align*}
Finally, these integrals are finite, which can be seen by the finiteness of the righthand side. Namely, if $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly to $f$ and the $f_n$ are bounded, then $f$ must be bounded. That means that $|f|$ is a bounded nonnegative function on $X$ which, together with $\mu(X)<\infty$, implies $|f|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$. This, in turn, implies $f\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ as well.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Discussion}: At the surface, part (b) looks very similar to part (a); however, there is one key difference: The sequence is not explicitly assumed to be bounded. We know the \emph{functions} are bounded, so for each $f_n$, there exists a $M_n$ such that $|f_n|\leq M_n$. But we cannot necessarily find a \emph{common} $M$ such that all functions are bounded by it, which disallows the application of the Dominated Convergence Theorem in part (a).

% Question 3
\newpage
\item \textbf{Exercise 88.7} In the following problems, we replace within the theorems the condition that must hold ``for all $x$'' with ``for \emph{almost} all $x$'' with respect to $\mu$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Theorem 88.6}: We want to show that the MTC holds if $f_n(x)\leq f_{n+1}(x)$ for \emph{almost} all $x$, rather than all $x$. So define the set
\begin{align*}
    E &= \{x \; | \; f_n > f_{n+1}\} \\
        &= \{x \; | \; f_n - f_{n+1} > 0\} \\
        &= \{x \; | \; g(x) > 0\} \qquad \qquad
        \text{where $g=f_n - f_{n+1}$} \\
    &= g^{-1}((0,\infty]) 
\end{align*}
Now because $f_n$ is measurable for all $n$, we know that $g=f_n-f_{n+1}$ will be measurable. And because $g$ is measurable, the set $E$ must be in the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathscr{M}$, which implies $X\setminus E\in\mathscr{M}$ as well.
\\
\\
Next, note that we can rewrite the integral of $f_n$ with respect to these two sets within the $\sigma$-algebra by Theorem 88.8:
\begin{align*}
    \int_X f_n \; d\mu &= \int_{X\setminus E} f_n \; d\mu
    + \int_E f_n \; d\mu\\
    &= \int_X f_n \Chi_{X\setminus E} \; d\mu+ 0
\end{align*}
because, by assumption, $\mu(E)=0$, which implies the integral over $E$ is zero for all $f_n$ and, even more generally, for \emph{all} measurable functions, which will include $\lim f_n$ below. 

Next, notice that the integral of $f_n\cdot\Chi_{X\setminus E}$ over $X$ satisifies all the criteria for applying the Monotone Convergence Theorem: The $f_n\cdot\Chi_{X\setminus E}$ are measurable, they converge to $f\cdot\Chi_{X\setminus E}$, and $f_n\cdot\Chi_{X\setminus E}\leq f_{n+1}\cdot\Chi_{X\setminus E}$ for all $x\in X\setminus E$, by construction. 
\\
\\
So we can apply the Monotone Converge Theorem to this set to derive
\[
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_{X\setminus E} f_n \; d\mu=
    \int_{X\setminus E} \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n \; d\mu
\]
We then use this in the final steps of the proof:
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_{X} f_n \; d\mu&=
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_{X\setminus E} f_n \; d\mu
    +
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_{E} f_n \; d\mu \\
    &= 
    \int_{X\setminus E} \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n \; d\mu
    + 0 \\
    &= 
    \int_{X\setminus E} \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n \; d\mu
    + \int_{E} \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n \; d\mu\\
    &= \int_{X} \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n \; d\mu
\end{align*}

% Ex 88.7, Theorem 88.13
\item \textbf{Theorem 88.13} Now suppose that $\{f_n\}^\infty_1$ is a sequence of nonnegative measurable functions and $f(x)=\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)$ for \emph{almost} all $x\in X$. We want to show that 
\begin{align*}
    \int_X f \; d\mu = \sum^\infty_{n=1} \int_X f_n \; d\mu
\end{align*}
So form the sets $E$ where $f(x)\neq  \sum^\infty_{n=1}$ and $X\setminus E$ where $f$ does equal the sum. Then, form the partial sum, which is an increasing sequence of nonnegative measurable functions on $X\setminus E$:
\[
    s_m = \sum^m_{n=1} f_n
\]
And so we start with
\begin{align}
    \label{q3.88.7}
    \int_X f \; d\mu &=  
    \int_X \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} s_n \; d\mu \notag \\
    &= \int_E \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} s_n \; d\mu +  
    \int_{X\setminus E} \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} s_n \; d\mu 
\end{align}
Because, by assumption $\mu(E)=0$, the first term in the righthand sum equals zero. For the second term on the righthand side, we're taking the limit over the part that satisfies all the conditions of 88.13, in which case we can use Theorem 88.13:
\begin{align*}
    \int_X f \; d\mu =  
    \int_{X\setminus E} \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} s_n \; d\mu =
    \sum^\infty_{n=1}\int_{X\setminus E} f_n \; d\mu 
\end{align*}
Finally, note that $\mu(E)=0$ implies
\begin{align*}
    \int_E f_n \; d\mu &= 0 \\
    \Rightarrow\quad  \sum^\infty_{n=1} \int_E f_n \;d\mu 
    &= \sum^\infty_{n=1}  0 = 0
\end{align*}
Now use this result with (\ref{q3.88.7}) to get
\begin{align*}
    \int_X f \; d\mu =  
    &= \sum^\infty_{n=1}\int_{X\setminus E} f_n \; d\mu 
    + \sum^\infty_{n=1} \int_E f_n \;d\mu \\
    &= \sum^\infty_{n=1}\int_{X} f_n \; d\mu 
\end{align*}

\item \textbf{Theorem 88.15}: Now suppose that $\{f_n\}$ is a sequence of measurable functions such that the limit exists for almost all $x\in X$ and that there exists a function $g\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ such that 
\[
    |f_n(x)|\leq g(x) \qquad\text{for almost all $x\in X$ and all $n$}
\]
Then we want to show that 
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X f_n \; d\mu
    = \int_X \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n \; d\mu
\end{align*}
To do so, we again let $E$ denote the set where the conditions do not hold, with $\mu(E)$. And again, anything integrated over $E$ will equal 0. So then 
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X f_n \; d\mu &= 
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \left( \int_{X\setminus E} f_n \; d\mu +
    \int_{E} f_n \; d\mu\right) \\
    &= \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}  \int_{X\setminus E} f_n \; d\mu  
    + \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}  \int_{E} f_n \; d\mu \\
    &= \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}  \int_{X\setminus E} f_n \; d\mu  
\end{align*}
Apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem to this integral over $X\setminus E$, which satisfies all the necessary conditions:
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}  \int_{X\setminus E} f_n \; d\mu  = 
    \int_{X\setminus E} \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}  f_n \; d\mu  
\end{align*}
Again, because $\mu(E)=0$, we have
\begin{align*}
    \int_{E} \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}  f_n \; d\mu  = 0
\end{align*}
So that we have
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X f_n \; d\mu 
    &= \int_{X\setminus E} \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}  f_n \; d\mu  
        + 0\\ 
    &= \int_{X\setminus E} \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}  f_n \; d\mu  
        + \int_{E} \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}  f_n \; d\mu \\ 
    &= \int_{X} \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}  f_n \; d\mu  
\end{align*}
which is what we wanted to show.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Exercise 88.12}: We have $f\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, and want to show that for all $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that 
\[
    \mu(E)<\delta \quad \text{for $E\in\mathscr{M}$ implies}
    \quad \int_E |f| \; d\mu <\varepsilon
\]
We will proceed via proof by contradiction.

As in the hint, take $\varepsilon>0$ and let $\{E_n\}^\infty_1 \subset \mathscr{M}$ such that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \mu(E_n)=0$. We know such a set exists because we always have $\emptyset \in \mathscr{M}$, where $\mu(\emptyset)$ always. Also, suppose by contradiction that for all $\delta$, there exists a $\varepsilon>0$ such that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q4}
    \varepsilon\leq \int_{E_n} |f| \; d\mu :=
    \int_X |f|\Chi_{E_n} \; d\mu
    \qquad\text{for all $n$}
\end{equation}
Next, define a sequence $\{f_n\}=\left\{|f|\chi_{E_n}\right\}$. A couple facts about our sequence and about $|f|$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $|f|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$. By Theorem 88.12, our assumption that $f\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ implies this result.
    \item $f_n$ is measurable, for all $n$. To see this, note that since $|f|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, $|f|$ is measurable. Also since $E_n\in\mathscr{M}$, $f_n = |f|\chi_{E_n}$ is also measurable, for all $n$.
    \item $f_n \leq |f|$: This is fairly obvious, after writing out the definition of $f_n$, 
\begin{equation}
    \label{dtcapply}
    f_n := |f|\Chi_{E_n}\leq |f|
\end{equation}
    \item $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n=0$. Note that since $\mu(E_n)\rightarrow 0$, it must be that $\Chi_{E_n}\rightarrow 0$, which sents $f_n$ to zero as $|f|$ is bounded.
\end{itemize}
So, let's use these facts to apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem. 

First, since $\{f_n\}$ is a measurable sequence of functions, bounded by $|f|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ for all $n$, we know that we can apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem, and exchange the limit and integral:
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X f_n \; d\mu&=
    \int_X \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n \; d\mu  \\ 
\end{align*}
Then, we can evaluate the limit within the integral, applying what was stated above:
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X f_n \; d\mu &=
    \int_X 0 \; d\mu = 0 \\ 
    \Rightarrow\quad
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X |f|\Chi_{E_n} \; 
    d\mu &= 0
\end{align*}
But this contradicts our assumption in Inequality \ref{q4}, which should hold for all $n$.


%Question 5
\newpage
\item \textbf{Exercise 88.13}: Now we have that $f_n:X\rightarrow[0,\infty]$ is a sequence of measurable functions such that $f_{n+1} \geq f_n \geq 0$ for all $n$, and that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} f_n = f$ for all $x\in X$. Moreover we also assume that $f_1\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, and we want to show that
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_X f_n \; d\mu
    = \int_X f \; d\mu
\end{equation}
To do so, first note that $f$ is measurable as a convergent limit of measurable functions. Then define the sequence
\[
    g_n(x) = f_1(x) - f_n(x)
\]
Because $\{f_n\}$ is decreasing, $\{g_n\}$ is an increasing sequence. Morover, $\{g_n\}$ is a sequence of measurable functions as the difference of two measurable functions. Now apply the usual Monotone Convergence Theorem:
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X g_n \; d\mu &= 
    \int_X \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} g_n \; d\mu
\end{align*}
which we can simplify
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X (f_1-f_n) \; d\mu &= 
    \int_X \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} (f_1-f_n) \; d\mu \\
    \Rightarrow\qquad
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X f_1 \; d\mu -
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X f_n \; d\mu &= 
    \int_X \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} f_1 \; d\mu 
    - \int_X \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} f_n \; d\mu \\ 
    \Leftrightarrow\qquad
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X f_n \; d\mu &= 
    \int_X \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} f_n \; d\mu 
\end{align*}
As an example of a sequence that might fail if $f_1\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ is ommitted, take $X$ to be the positive real line, and let 
\[
    f_n(x) = \begin{cases} x & x> n \\ 0 & x \leq n
    \end{cases}
\] 
Then, 
\[
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} f_n = 0 \quad 
    \Rightarrow\quad
    \int_X \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} f_n \; d\mu = 0 
\]
However, if we take any particular $n$
\[
    \int_X f_n \; d\mu = \infty
    \quad \Rightarrow\quad
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_X f_n \; d\mu = \infty
\]



% Quesiton 6
\newpage 
\item \textbf{Exercise 88.15}: For a sequence of measurable functions $\{f_n\}$, we're told that $\sum^\infty_{n=1} |f_n(x)|$ converges for all $x\in X$, and that $\sum^\infty_{n=1}|f_n(x)|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$. 
\begin{enumerate}
    % Part 6a
    \item First, we want to prove that $\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)$ converges for all $x\in X$. Begin by noting that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q6a.1}
    \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x) \leq 
    \left\lvert\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)\right\rvert =
    c \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)
\end{equation}
where $c=1$ or $-1$. Then, it's clear that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q6a.2}
    c \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x) =
    \sum^\infty_{n=1} c f_n(x) \leq
    \sum^\infty_{n=1} \left\lvert f_n(x) \right\rvert
    <\infty
\end{equation}
where the final inequality follows from the assumption that $\sum^\infty_{n=1} |f_n(x)|$ converges for all $x$. Putting (\ref{q6a.1}) and (\ref{q6a.2}) together, we see
\begin{equation}
    0\leq \left\lvert\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x) \right\rvert\leq 
    \sum^\infty_{n=1} \left\lvert f_n(x) \right\rvert
    <\infty
\end{equation}
so that $\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)$ is finite and converges for all $x$.

% Part 6b
\item Next, we want to show that $\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n\in \mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$. But to show this, we just need to show that $\left\lvert\sum^\infty_{n=1}f_n\right\rvert\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, and then apply Theorem 88.12.
\\
\\
But first, a result from class states that because the $f_n$ are measurable and because $\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n$ converges (by part (a)), we know that the sum is measurable, which implies the absolute value $\left\lvert\sum^\infty_{n=1}f_n\right\rvert$ is measurable too. 
\\
\\
Next, note from (\ref{q6a.1}) and (\ref{q6a.2}) that 
\begin{align*}
    0\leq 
    \left\lvert \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)\right\rvert \leq
    \sum^\infty_{n=1} \left\lvert 
        f_n(x)\right\rvert 
\end{align*}
Then use monotonicity of the integral on these measurable functions to get
\begin{align*}
    \int_X 0\;d\mu &\leq 
    \int_X 
    \left\lvert \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)\right\rvert 
    \; d\mu
    \leq
    \int_X\sum^\infty_{n=1} \left\lvert 
        f_n(x)\right\rvert \;d\mu < \infty \\
    \Rightarrow \quad
    0 &\leq
    \int_X 
    \left\lvert \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)\right\rvert 
    \; d\mu <\infty
\end{align*}
And because the integral is finite, we know that $\left\lvert \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n \right\rvert\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, which implies $\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n \in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ by Theorem 88.12.

% Q6c 
\item Finally, we want to prove that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q6c.target}
    \int_X \left( \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n\right) d\mu
    = \sum^\infty_{n=1} \int_X f_n \; d\mu
\end{equation}
So start by defining the partial sum, which is a measurable function as a finite sum of measurable functions:
\begin{equation}
    g_m = \sum^m_{n=1} f_n
\end{equation}
Note that, by what we showed in part (a), we have 
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} g_m = 
    \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} \sum^m_{n=1} <\infty
    \quad \Rightarrow\quad
    g_m\rightarrow \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)
\end{equation}
Now rewrite Equality \ref{q6c.target} in a more suggestive, but equivalent statement
\begin{align}
    \label{q6.crux}
    \int_X \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} g_m \; d\mu =
    \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} \int_X g_m \; d\mu
\end{align}
The first term is obviously equivalent to that of Equality \ref{q6c.target}, and the second can be shown as equivalent because, for any $m$, we can apply Theorem 88.11 to write
\[
    \int_X g_m \; d\mu 
    = \int_X \sum^m_{n=1}f_n \; d\mu
    = \sum^m_{n=1}\int_X f_n \; d\mu
\]
And while the sequence $\{g_m\}$ is a sequence of measurable functions, we just need to show that we can bound the sequence for all $m$ and $x$, after which we can apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem.
\\
\\
So start by using facts from and simplifications similar to parts (a) and (b)
\[
    |g_m| =
    \left\lvert \sum^m_{n=1} f_n \right\rvert \leq 
    \sum^m_{n=1} \left\lvert f_n \right\rvert \leq 
    \sum^\infty_{n=1} \left\lvert f_n \right\rvert
    <\infty
\]
We now have a sequence of measurable functions $\{g_m\}$ whose limit exists for all $x\in X$, since $\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n$ is convergent. We also have a function, $\sum^\infty_{n=1}|f_n|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ bounding $\{g_m\}$. Then, we can apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem to say that Equation \ref{q6.crux} holds, a statement which is exactly equivalent to what we want to prove: Equation \ref{q6c.target}.

\newpage
% Question 7
\item We start with the function $|f|>0$, which is measurable because $f$ is integrable and $|f|$ is a continuous transformation of $f$. We also know that $|f|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ by Theorem 88.12. Now consider the set
\[
    A_1 = |f|^{-1}([t,\infty]) = \{x \;:\; |f(x)|\geq t\}
    \qquad t>0
\]
Next, let $A_2 = X\setminus A_1$. 

We now construct a simple function $s$:
\[
    s = t\cdot \Chi_{A_1} + 0 \cdot \Chi_{A_2}
\]
First, it's obvious that $0\leq s$ because $t>0$. Second, it's obvious that $s\leq |f|$, because we've partitioned the range of $|f|$ into two segments: the parts greater than $t$ (which are mapped from $A_1$) and everything else (which cannot be less than zero).

Now, by the definition of the integral, we have that 
\[
    \int_X |f| \; d\mu = \sup_{0\leq s \leq f} \int_X s\;d\mu
    \qquad\Rightarrow\qquad
    \int_X |f| \; d\mu \geq \int_X s\;d\mu
\]
where the $s$ in the second inequality is the $s$ defined above. So now, let's compute it:
\begin{align*}
    \int_X |f| \; d\mu \geq \int_X s\;d\mu
    &= t \mu(A_1) + 0 \mu(A_2) \\
    &= t \mu(A_1) 
\end{align*}
Rearranging, and substituting in for $A_1$, we see that
\begin{equation}
    \mu\left(\{x \;:\; |f(x)|\geq t\}\right) \leq
    \frac{1}{t}\int_X |f| \; d\mu 
\end{equation}

{\textbf{Part 2}}: Suppose that $\varepsilon>0$ is given. We want to find a subsequence such that $|f_{n_k}|\leq \varepsilon$ for sufficiently large $k$, which indicates convergence of the subsequence to zero.
\\
\\
To do so, we use the fact that since $\int_X |f_n| \; d\mu\rightarrow 0$, we know that for all $1/k$, we can find an $n_k$ such that 
\[
    \frac{1}{\varepsilon} \int_X |f_n| \; d\mu \leq \frac{1}{k}
\]
So choose $n_k$ based on the convergence of the integral, and we'll use these indices to define the subsequence. 

Having done so, we can apply the first part that
\[
    \mu\left(\left\{ x\; | \; |f_{n_k}|\geq \varepsilon \right\}\right) 
    \leq \frac{1}{\varepsilon} \int_X |f_{n_k}| \; d\mu 
    \leq \frac{1}{k}
\]
And sending $k$ to infinity, we see that the set of points where $|f_{n_k}(x)| >\varepsilon$ (that is, where it does not converge to zero) is measure zero.
\\
\\
As an example, take a function
\[
    f(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{$x$ is an integer} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
\]
Then $\int_X |f| \; d\mu=0$. We also have $f(x)=0$ almost everywhere because the set of non-zero points is measure zero. But there clearly exists a subsequence whose limit is 0.
