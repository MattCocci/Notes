\begin{enumerate} 

% Question 1
\item \textbf{Exercise 88.5}: $(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ is a positive measure space, and we then define a relative measure space $(E,\mathscr{M}_E,\lambda)$ where $\lambda(A)=\mu(A\cap E)$.

\begin{enumerate}
% Question 1a
\item For $f\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, we want to show that $f|_E \in\mathscr{L}(E,\mathscr{M}_E,\lambda)$ and that
\[
    \int_E f|_E \; d\lambda = \int_X f \Chi_E\; d\mu
\]
First, show that $f|_E$ is $\mathscr{M}_E$ measurable so that the integral makes sense (previous exercise).

Then show $f|_E \leq f$ for all $E\subset X$, so that $\int_X f|_E \; d\mu$ will be integrable. (Start with nonneg functions, then generalize.) 

Now if we show $\int_E f|_E \; d\lambda$ equals that value, the integral is finite, so the result is achieved.

$(\leq)$ First show that $f\chi_E$ is measurable, and that the integral is finite. Then take any simple function for the $E$ case, unpack it, to get it into $X$ space, then take the sup.

$(\geq)$ Unpack the righthand side, sup the left.

% 1b 
\item Show that $g$ is measurable in $X$ space.  

\end{enumerate}

% Question 2
\item In both, we have a positive measure space, $(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, with $\mu(X)<\infty$.

\begin{enumerate} 

% Question 2a
\item \textbf{Exercise 88.6}: We have a sequence of measurable functions $\{f_n\}_1^\infty$ such that $f=\lim f_n$. We also know that the $f_n$ are bounded so that $|f_n(x)|\leq M$ for all $n$ and $x$. 

This setup lends itself nicely to using the Dominated Convergence Theorem.  Specifically, set $g(x)=M$. A constant function is clearly measurable, and because $\mu(X)<\infty$ we know from class and by Theorem 88.4 in the book that $\int_X g \; d\mu$ exists (and is finite) so that $g\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$.

Thus we satisfy the conditions of the Dominated Convergence Theorem because $f_n$ is measurable, $\lim f_n$ exists for all $x$, and $|f_n|\leq g\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$. Thus, 
\[
  \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X f_n \; d\mu  
  = \int_X \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} f_n \; d\mu
  = \int_X  f \; d\mu
\]

% Question 2b
\item \textbf{Exercise 88.10}: For this question, we have a sequence of bounded real measurable functions $\{f_n\}^\infty_1$ on $X$ such that $f_n\rightarrow f$ uniformly. We again want to show that 
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X f_n \; d\mu
    = \int_X f \; d\mu
\end{equation}
    
($\leq$ Direction) First, we know that because $f_n\rightarrow f$ uniformly, $f$ is measurable, so we can integrate. We also know that for any $\varepsilon>0$, we can find an $N$ such that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{stillholds}
    f_n \in (f-\varepsilon, f+\varepsilon) 
    \qquad \text{For all $n>N$ and $x\in X$}
\end{equation}
And so we know that $f_N\leq f+\varepsilon$, to which we can apply the monotonicity of the integral
\begin{equation}
    \label{q2.tolim}
    \int_X f_N \; d\mu \leq \int_X (f+\varepsilon) \; d\mu
    <\infty
\end{equation}
Note, $f+\varepsilon$ is measurable because it's the sum of two measurable functions: $f$ and a constant, $\varepsilon$. We can also say that the integral of $f+\varepsilon$ is finite (i.e. it exists) because we have a measurable function over a space $X$ where $\mu(X)<\infty$. So by the same reasoning as in part $(a)$, integral is finite.

Now take the limit of Inequality \ref{q2.tolim} with respect to $N$. 
\begin{equation}
    L=\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}
    \int_X f_N \; d\mu \leq \int_X (f+\varepsilon) \; d\mu
\end{equation}
The inequality will still hold because Statement (\ref{stillholds}) holds for all $n>N$. But $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, so take the limit as $\varepsilon\rightarrow0$ to get that 
\begin{equation}
    L \leq \int_X f \; d\mu
\end{equation}

($\geq$ Direction) Now, by the same reasoning, we know that as above, we know that $f - \varepsilon \leq f_N$, $f-\varepsilon$ is measurable, and the integral of $f$ is finite, since it measurable on 


\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Discussion}: At the surface, part (b) looks very similar to part (a); however, there is one key difference: The sequence is not necessarily bounded. We know the functions are bounded, so for each $f_n$, there exists a $M_n$ such that $|f_n|\leq M_n$. But we cannot necessarily find a \emph{common} $M$ such that all functions are bounded by it, which disallows the application of the Dominated Convergence Theorem in part (a).

% Question 88.12
\item We have $f\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, and want to show that for all $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that 
\[
    \mu(E)<\delta \quad \text{for $E\in\mathscr{M}$ implies}
    \quad \int_E |f| \; d\mu <\varepsilon
\]
We will proceed via proof by contradiction.

As in the hint, take $\varepsilon>0$ and let $\{E_n\}^\infty_1 \subset \mathscr{M}$ such that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \mu(E_n)=0$. We know such a set exists because we always have $\emptyset \in \mathscr{M}$, where $\mu(\emptyset)$ always. Also, suppose by contradiction that for all $\delta$, there exists a $\varepsilon>0$ such that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q4}
    \varepsilon\leq \int_{E_n} |f| \; d\mu :=
    \int_X |f|\Chi_{E_n} \; d\mu
    \qquad\text{for all $n$}
\end{equation}
Next, define a sequence $\{f_n\}=\left\{|f|\chi_{E_n}\right\}$. A couple facts about our sequence and about $|f|$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $|f|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$. By Theorem 88.12, our assumption that $f\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ implies this result.
    \item $f_n$ is measurable, for all $n$. To see this, note that since $|f|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, $|f|$ is measurable, and since $E_n\in\mathscr{M}$, $f_n = |f|\chi_{E_n}$ is also measurable, for all $n$.
    \item $f_n \leq |f|$: This is fairly obvious, after writing out the definition of $f_n$, 
\begin{equation}
    \label{dtcapply}
    f_n := |f|\Chi_{E_n}\leq |f|
\end{equation}
    \item $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n=0$. Note that since $\mu(E_n)\rightarrow 0$, it must be that $\Chi_{E_n}\rightarrow 0$. 
\end{itemize}
So, let's use these facts to apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem. 

First, since $\{f_n\}$ is a measurable sequence of functions, bounded by $|f|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ for all $n$, we know that we can apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem, and exchange the limit and integral:
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X f_n \; d\mu&=
    \int_X \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_n \; d\mu  \\ 
\end{align*}
Then, we can evaluate the limit within the integral, applying what was stated above:
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X f_n \; d\mu &=
    \int_X 0 \; d\mu = 0 \\ 
    \Rightarrow\quad
    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_X |f|\Chi_{E_n} \; 
    d\mu &= 0
\end{align*}
But this contradicts our assumption in Inequality \ref{q4}, which should hold for all $n$.


% Quesiton 6
\newpage 
\item \textbf{Exercise 88.15}: For a sequence of measurable functions $\{f_n\}$, we're told that $\sum^\infty_{n=1} |f_n(x)|$ converges for all $x\in X$, and that $\sum^\infty_{n=1}|f_n(x)|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$. 
\begin{enumerate}
    % Part 6a
    \item First, we want to prove that $\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)$ converges for all $x\in X$. Begin by noting that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q6a.1}
    \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x) \leq 
    \left\lvert\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)\right\rvert =
    c \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)
\end{equation}
where $c=1$ or $-1$. Then, it's clear that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q6a.2}
    c \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x) =
    \sum^\infty_{n=1} c f_n(x) \leq
    \sum^\infty_{n=1} \left\lvert f_n(x) \right\rvert
    <\infty
\end{equation}
where the final inequality follows from the assumption that $\sum^\infty_{n=1} |f_n(x)|$ converges for all $x$. Putting (\ref{q6a.1}) and (\ref{q6a.2}) together, we see
\begin{equation}
    \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x) \leq 
    \sum^\infty_{n=1} \left\lvert f_n(x) \right\rvert
    <\infty
\end{equation}
so that $\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)$ converges for all $x$.

% Part 6b
\item Next, we want to show that $\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n\in \mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$. But to show this, we just need to show that $\left\lvert\sum^\infty_{n=1}f_n\right\rvert\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, and then apply Theorem 88.12.
\\
\\
But first, a result from class states that because the $f_n$ are measurable, and because $\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n$ converges (by part (a)), we know that the sum is measurable, which implies the absolute value $\left\lvert\sum^\infty_{n=1}f_n\right\rvert$ is measurable too. 
\\
\\
Next, note from (\ref{q6a.1}) and (\ref{q6a.2}) that 
\begin{align*}
    0\leq 
    \left\lvert \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)\right\rvert \leq
    \sum^\infty_{n=1} \left\lvert 
        f_n(x)\right\rvert 
\end{align*}
Then use monotonicity of the integral on these measurable functions to get
\begin{align*}
    \int_X 0\;d\mu &\leq 
    \int_X 
    \left\lvert \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)\right\rvert 
    \; d\mu
    \leq
    \int_X\sum^\infty_{n=1} \left\lvert 
        f_n(x)\right\rvert \;d\mu < \infty \\
    \Rightarrow \quad
    0 &\leq
    \int_X 
    \left\lvert \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)\right\rvert 
    \; d\mu <\infty
\end{align*}
And because the integral is finite, we know that $\left\lvert \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n \right\rvert\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$, which implies $\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n \in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ by Theorem 88.12.

% Q6c 
\item Finally, we want to prove that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q6c.target}
    \int_X \left( \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n\right) d\mu
    = \sum^\infty_{n=1} \int_X f_n \; d\mu
\end{equation}
So start by defining the partial sum, which is a measurable function as a finite sum of measurable functions:
\begin{equation}
    g_m = \sum^m_{n=1} f_n
\end{equation}
Note that, by what we showed in part (a), we have 
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} g_m = 
    \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} \sum^m_{n=1} <\infty
    \quad \Rightarrow\quad
    g_m\rightarrow \sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n(x)
\end{equation}
Now rewrite Equality \ref{q6c.target} in a more suggestive, but equivalent statement
\begin{align}
    \label{q6.crux}
    \int_X \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} g_m \; d\mu =
    \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} \int_X g_m \; d\mu
\end{align}
The first term is obviously equilvalent to that of Equality \ref{q6c.target}, and the second can be shown as equivalent because, for any $m$, we can apply Theorem 88.11 to write
\[
    \int_X g_m \; d\mu 
    = \int_X \sum^m_{n=1}f_n \; d\mu
    = \sum^m_{n=1}\int_X f_n \; d\mu
\]
And while the sequence $\{g_m\}$ is a sequence of measurable functions, we just need to show that we can bound the sequence for all $m$ and $x$, after which we can apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem.
\\
\\
So start by using facts from and simplifications similar to parts (a) and (b)
\[
    |g_m| =
    \left\lvert \sum^m_{n=1} f_n \right\rvert \leq 
    \sum^m_{n=1} \left\lvert f_n \right\rvert \leq 
    \sum^\infty_{n=1} \left\lvert f_n \right\rvert
    <\infty
\]
We now have a sequence of measurable functions $\{g_m\}$ whose limit exists for all $x\in X$, since $\sum^\infty_{n=1} f_n$ is convergent. We also have a function, $\sum^\infty_{n=1}|f_n|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ bounding $\{g_m\}$. Then, we can apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem to say that Equation \ref{q6.crux} holds, a statement which is exactly equivalent to what we want to prove: Equation \ref{q6c.target}.





    


\end{enumerate}



\newpage
% Question 7
\item We start with the function $|f|>0$, which is measurable because $f$ is integrable and $|f|$ is a continuous transformation of $f$. We also know that $|f|\in\mathscr{L}(X,\mathscr{M},\mu)$ by Theorem 88.12. Now consider the set
\[
    A_1 = |f|^{-1}([t,\infty]) = \{x \;:\; |f(x)|\geq t\}
    \qquad t>0
\]
Next, let $A_2 = X\setminus A_1$. 

We now construct a simple function $s$:
\[
    s = t\cdot \Chi_{A_1} + 0 \cdot \Chi_{A_2}
\]
First, it's obvious that $0\leq s$ because $t>0$. Second, it's obvious that $s\leq |f|$, because we've partitioned the range of $|f|$ into two segments: the parts greater than $t$ (which are mapped from $A_1$) and everything else (which cannot be less than zero).

Now, by the definition of the integral, we have that 
\[
    \int_X |f| \; d\mu = \sup_{0\leq s \leq f} \int_X s\;d\mu
    \qquad\Rightarrow\qquad
    \int_X |f| \; d\mu \geq \int_X s\;d\mu
\]
where the $s$ in the second inequality is the $s$ defined above. So now, let's compute it:
\begin{align*}
    \int_X |f| \; d\mu \geq \int_X s\;d\mu
    &= t \mu(A_1) + 0 \mu(A_2) \\
    &= t \mu(A_1) 
\end{align*}
Rearranging, and substituting in for $A_1$, we see that
\begin{equation}
    \mu\left(\{x \;:\; |f(x)|\geq t\}\right) \leq
    \frac{1}{t}\int_X |f| \; d\mu 
\end{equation}




\end{enumerate}
