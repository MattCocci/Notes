\begin{enumerate}

\item 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Exercise 57.7}: We want to show that $f$ continuous on $[a,b]$ with $f(x)=0$ almost everywhere on $[a,b]$ implies that $f(x)=0$ for all $x\in[a,b]$. We'll do so by contradiction.

So suppose that $f(x)=0$ almost everywhere, but there exists an $x\in[a,b]$ such that $f(x)\neq 0$. That means that 
\[ 
    |f(x)| > \varepsilon \qquad \text{for some $\varepsilon>0$}
\]
Then, using this $\varepsilon$, by the continuity of $f$, we know that there exists a $\delta>0$ such that
\[
    |x-y|<\delta \quad \Rightarrow \quad |f(x)-f(y)|<\varepsilon
\]
Now since this is the case, we can say that
\[
    y\in(x-\delta, x+\delta) \quad \Rightarrow \quad 
    f(y) \in \left(f(x)-\varepsilon, f(x)+\varepsilon\right)
\]
Supposing, without loss of generality, that $f(x) > 0$, we have that 
\[
    f(x) > \varepsilon \quad \Rightarrow \quad
    f(x) - \varepsilon > 0
\]
Thus, we can conclude that, $f(y) > 0$ for all $y\in(x-\delta, x+\delta)$.\footnote{A similar result holds if $f(x)<0$, just flip the direction of the inequality.} And so we have an interval $(f(x-\delta), f(x+\delta))$ 

\item \textbf{Exercise 57.8}: We want to show that if $\alpha\in BV([a,b])$, then $\alpha$ is continuous almost everywhere in $[a,b]$.  

Now if we want a cheap proof, we can say that $\alpha$ is of bounded variation, and so it's Riemann Integrable. In that case, by Lebesgue's Theorem, $\alpha$ is continuous almost everywhere, and we're done.

\newpage
\emph{But}, that's kind of cheating. So let's use the hint, which says to prove that a monotonic function has at most countably many points of discontinuity. If we can prove this, then we're done. Here's the steps and results from class that motivate that statement:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We know from class that our function $\alpha$ of bounded variation can be represented as the difference of monotonically increasing functions, $u$ and $v$.
    \item By the hint we will prove, each monotonic function will have at most countably many points of discontinuity. Call those sets of points $D_u$ and $D_v$.
    \item Since these two sets $D_u$ and $D_v$ are at most countable, each set will be of measure zero by a result we saw in class. 
    \item Since the total set of discontinuities for $f$ is the union $D_u \cup D_v$, we know that this finite union of at most countable sets will be at most countable, and so measure zero.
    \item Finally, we now have that the set of discountinuities of $f$ is measure zero, implying $f$ is continuous almost everywhere.
\end{enumerate}
Now let's prove that monontonic functions have at most countable many points of discontinuities, so that whole line of reasoning doesn't fall apart.

Let $A$ equal the set of discontinuities of $f$. Denote the righthand limit at $a\in A$ as $f(a^+)$, and lefthand limit as $f(a^-)$. Now since $f$ is monotonic, we know that $f(a^-) < f(a^+)$. Now because we're on the real line, we know that there exists a $q_a\in\mathbb{Q}$ such that
\[
    f(a^-) < q_a < f(a^+)   \qquad \forall a \in A
\]
And because $f$ is monotonic, each $q_a$ will be unique for each point of discontinuity. That's because if $b$ is a point of discontinuity greater than $a$, then $f(b^-)>f(a^+)$ by the monotonicity of $f$. 
\\
\\
And so this establishes a one-to-one correspondence between $A$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ (or a subset of $\mathbb{Q}$ if $A$ finite). So $A$ is countable.

\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Exercise 58.1}: Let $f\in\mathscr{R}([a,b])$ and suppose $\int^x_a f\;dx = 0$ for all $x\in(a,b]$. We want to show that $f(x)=0$ almost everywhere in $[a,b]$. We'll do this by contradiction, in a manner similar to Question (1a).

Start with the fact that $f\in\mathscr{R}([a,b])$. First, by the Fundamental Theorem of calculus, $F(x)=\int^x_a f\;dx$ is continuous and differentiable wherever $f$ is continuous. Also, by Lebesgue's theorem, $f$ is continuous almost everywhere. 

So let $x^*$ be a point where $f$ is continuous in $(a,b]$. Without loss of generality, assume that it is greater than the first point of discontinuity. Then, because $f$ is continuous, we know that for any $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that 
\[
    |x^*-x|<\delta \quad \Rightarrow \quad |f(x^*)-f(x)|<\varepsilon
\]
\newpage
Now take $\varepsilon$ to be the distance from this $x^*$ to the nearest point of discontinuity less than $x^*$, and choose $\delta$ accordingly. Then, we can write $F(x^*)$ as 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q2}
    F(x^*) = \int^{x^*}_a f\;dx = 
    \int^{x^* - \delta}_a f\;dx +
    \int^{x^*}_{x^* - \delta} f\;dx
\end{equation}
Now it's clear that $\int^{x^* - \delta}_a f\;dx$ will equal zero by an assumption of the problem. 
\\
\\
As for $\int^{x^*}_{x^* - \delta} f\;dx$, we know that $f=0$ for all $x$ over the interval. To show this, suppose without loss of generality that $f(x)>0$ over the interval. Then the integral is nonzero, and the sum on the right in Equation \ref{q2} is positive. But this would give us a contradiction because $F(x)$ is assumed to equal zero for all $x\in(a,b]$, including $x^*$.
    
\item 
Let $S$ equal the set of all finite unions of intervals in $\mathbb{R}$:
\[
    S = \left\{ \bigcup^n_{i=1} I_i \quad | \quad
    I_i \text{ is an interval in }  \mathbb{R} 
    \right\}
\]
First, we show that this is an algebra. To do so, we need to show that the properties of an algebra are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To show $A\in{S}\Rightarrow A^c\in S$, write out $A$:
    \[ 
        A = \bigcup^n_{i=1} I_i  
    \]
    By DeMorgan's laws, we can rewrite
    \begin{align*}
        A^c &= \left(\bigcup^n_{i=1} I_i \right)^c 
        = \bigcap^n_{i=1} I^c_i  \\
    \end{align*}
    But for an interval 
    
\end{itemize}

\item \begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Exercise 86.5}\begin{enumerate}
\item Given a collection $\{\mathscr{M}_\alpha\}$ of $\sigma$-algebras on $X$, we want to show that $\cap \mathscr{M}_\alpha$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$. 
    
We first show that the intersection satisfies the condition for an algebra. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose that $M \in \cap \mathscr{M}_\alpha$. Then $M\in \mathscr{M}_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$. If this is the case, then it's complement, $M^c$ must also be in $\mathscr{M}_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$, because each is an algebra itself. Thus $M^c$ is in $\cap \mathscr{M}_\alpha$. 

\item Next, suppose that $M_1, M_2 \in \cap \mathscr{M}_\alpha$. Then $M_1 \cup M_2$ is in each $\mathscr{M}_\alpha$, implying that their union is too.
\end{itemize}

Next, we show that the intersection satisfies the key condition for $\sigma$-algebras: being closed under countable unions. 

So suppose that we have each $\{M_1, M_2, \ldots\}$ in $\cap \mathscr{M}_\alpha$. Well then, exactly as above, that implies $M_i \in \mathscr{M}_\alpha$ for all $i$, so their union will be as well, since each $\mathscr{M}_\alpha$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. And so 
\[ 
    \bigcup^\infty_{n=1} M_i \in \mathscr{M}_\alpha \;
    \text{ for all $\alpha$} 
    \quad \Rightarrow\quad
    \bigcup^\infty_{n=1} M_i \in \cap\mathscr{M}_\alpha 
\]
which implies $\cap \mathscr{M}_\alpha$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.

\item For an example of two $\sigma$-algebras whose union is not a $\sigma$-algebra, consider $\mathscr{A}_1$ and $\mathscr{A}_2$ in part (b) of this problem. I'll construct them so that each is a $\sigma$-algebra, though their union is not even an algebra, disqualifying them from being a $\sigma$-algebra as well.

\end{enumerate}

\item
To show that a union of two algebras need not be an algebra, consider the following two algebras:
\begin{align*}
\mathscr{A}_1 &= \{ A \subset \mathbb{Z} \; | \;
A \text{ or } A^c \text{ all odd} \} \\
\mathscr{A}_2 &= \{ A \subset \mathbb{Z} \; | \;
A \text{ or } A^c \text{ all even} \}
\end{align*}
\textbf{Showing Each is an Algebra}: We need to show the two conditions are satisfied. We'll work with $\mathscr{A}_1$, whose results can easily be modified to apply to $\mathscr{A}_2$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item First, by the criterion that the set \emph{or} it's complement is odd, we guarantee that $A\in\mathscr{A}_1$ implies $A^c\in\mathscr{A}_1$.

    \item Suppose $A_1$ and $A_2$ are all odd. Then their union is all odd and clearly in $\mathscr{A}_1$. Instead, if $A_1$ and $A_2$ are such that $A_1^c$ and $A_2^c$ are all odd, then their union is in $\mathscr{A}_1$ as well. This is because $(A_1 \cup A_2)^c = A_1^c \cap A_2^c$, which is the intersection of odd numbers. So either that interesection is odd, which is 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Showing Each is a $\sigma$-Algebra}: Taking $\mathscr{A}_1$ without loss of generality, a countable union of odd numbers will surely be odd. For sets whose complement is odd, taking a 

\textbf{Showing $A_1\cup A_2$ is Neither}: Now, we can also easily show that $\mathscr{A}_1 \cup \mathscr{A}_2$ is not an algebra. We do this by taking the sets
\[
A_1 \cup A_2 = \{1\} \cup \{2\} = \{1,2\}
\qquad A_1 \subset \mathscr{A}_1
\quad A_2 \subset \mathscr{A}_2
\]
Now since $\{1,2\}$ has both odd and even numbers (and so does its compliment) $A_1 \cup A_2$ will be in neither $\mathscr{A}_1 \cup \mathscr{A}_2$. Therefore, it won't be in $\mathscr{A}_1 \cup \mathscr{A}_2$, violating a basic property of algebras.
\end{enumerate}


\newpage
\item We define a complete measure space $(X,\mathscr{M}, \mu)$ to be a measure space where 
\[
    A\subset B\in\mathscr{M} \; \text{ s.t. }\;\mu(B)=0 
    \quad\Rightarrow\quad A\in\mathscr{M}
\]
We then let 
\[
    \bar{\mathscr{M}} = \left\{ S\cup A \; | \;  
        S\in\mathscr{M}, \; A\subset B\in\mathscr{M}, \;  
        \mu(B)=0
    \right\}
\]
Finally, We define 
\[
    \bar{\mu}(S\cup A) = \mu(S)  \qquad 
    \text{for $\bar{\mu}$ on $\bar{\mathscr{M}}$}
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item We first want to show that $\bar{\mu}$ is well-defined. To do so, suppose that we have $S_1, S_2\in\mathscr{M}$ with 
\[
    S_1 \cup A_1 = S_2 \cup A_2 
    \qquad \text{where} \quad
    \begin{cases}
    A_1 \subset B_1 &\mu(B_1) = 0\\ A_2 \subset B_2 &\mu(B_2) = 0
    \end{cases}
\]
Then we need to show that $\bar{\mu}(S_1\cup A_1):=\bar{\mu}(S_1)$ equals $\bar{\mu}(S_2\cup A_2):=\bar{\mu}(S_2)$. But we know
\begin{align*}
    S_1 &\subset S_1 \cup A_1 = S_2 \cup A_2 \subset 
        S_2 \cup B_2 \\
    \Rightarrow \qquad
    \mu(S_1) &\leq 
        \mu(S_2 \cup B_2) = \mu(S_2) + \mu(B_2) = 
        \mu(S_2) + 0 \\
    \Rightarrow \qquad
        \mu(S_1) &\leq 
        \mu(S_2)
\end{align*}
It's exactly the same reasoning to show $\mu(S_2) \leq \mu(S_1)$, which implies $\mu(S_1) = \mu(S_2)$. So $\bar{\mu}$ is well defined.

\item Next, we want to show that $\bar{\mathscr{M}}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. 

\end{enumerate}


\item 
\item Given $X=\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathscr{M} = \{\emptyset, \mathbb{R}, [0,\infty), (-\infty,0)\}$, we want to show that $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is measurable if and only if $f=a+b\chi_{[0,\infty)}$ for some $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$.
    
    Use Theorem 4.6.4 from the notes. Draw the function to get intuition.

For other direction, show contrapositive.
