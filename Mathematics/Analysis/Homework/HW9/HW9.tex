\maketitle 

\begin{enumerate} 

% Question 1
\item Let $f$ be a function that is Lipschitz. We want to prove that it is absolutely continuous. So let $C$ and $\eta$ be non-negative constants such that that 
\begin{equation}
\label{lip}
    |x-y|<\eta
    \quad\Rightarrow\quad
    |f(x)-f(y)|<C|x-y|
\end{equation}
Then, fix $\varepsilon>0$ and choose $\delta$ such that
\begin{equation}
\label{q1.step}
    \sum_{i=1}^N|b_i-a_i| \leq 
    \delta := \frac{\min\{\varepsilon,\eta\}}{C}
\end{equation}
This choice of $\delta$ obviously implies that $(b_i-a_i)<\eta$ for all $i$. So 
now let's use that together with Condition \ref{lip} to bound the target sum by $\varepsilon$:
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^N |f(b_i)-f(a_i)| \leq 
    \sum_{i=1}^N C|b_i-a_i| &=
    C \sum_{i=1}^N |b_i-a_i| \\
    \text{By (\ref{q1.step})} \qquad
    &\leq 
    C \cdot \frac{\min\{\varepsilon,\eta\}}{C}
    = \min\{\varepsilon,\eta\}
\end{align*}
Clearly, the sum is bounded by $\varepsilon$.




% Question 2
\item 
\begin{enumerate} 

% Part a
\item Suppose that we have a composition $f\circ g$. We want to show that, for fixed $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta$ such that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q2a}
    \sum_{i=1}^N |b_i-a_i|<\delta 
    \quad\Rightarrow\quad
    \sum_{i=1}^N |f(g(b_i))-f(g(a_i))|<\varepsilon
\end{equation}
The ``obvious'' attempt says to, fixing $\varepsilon$, find the relevant $\delta_f$ for the function $f$ such that
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^N |b_i-a_i|<\delta_f
    \quad\Rightarrow\quad
    \sum_{i=1}^N |f(b_i)-f(a_i)|<\varepsilon
\]
Then, let this $\delta_f$ be the new $\varepsilon'$, and find $\delta_g$ for the function $g$ such that
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^N |b_i-a_i|<\delta_g
    \quad\Rightarrow\quad
    \sum_{i=1}^N |g(b_i)-g(a_i)|<\varepsilon' := \delta_f
\]
In a sense, this approach tries to control the size of the second sum in (\ref{q2a}) in two stages. We want the intervals to be sufficiently small such that, when mapped by $g$, the result will still be sufficiently small for when $f$ maps them.

% Part b
\item ($f$ Absolutely Continuous) Let $\varepsilon$ and $N$ (the number of disjoint intervals) be given. Then choose $\delta$ such that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q2b}
    \delta:= \frac{\varepsilon^2}{N^2}
\end{equation}
For any individual open interval $(b_i-a_i)\subset[0,1]$, we see that $|b_i-a_i|<\delta$, so that
\begin{align*}
    |f({b_i})-f({a_i})|^2 &\leq
    \left(\sqrt{b_i}-\sqrt{a_i}\right)\left(\sqrt{b_i}+\sqrt{a_i}\right) 
    = b_i - a_i < \delta := \frac{\varepsilon^2}{N^2} \\
    \Rightarrow\quad
    |f({b_i})-f({a_i})|^2 &\leq \frac{\varepsilon^2}{N^2} \\
    \Leftrightarrow\quad
    |f({b_i})-f({a_i})| &\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{N} 
\end{align*}
Since this is true for all $i$, we can sum over the $N$ intervals to get 
\[
  \sum_{i=1}^N  |f({b_i})-f({a_i})| 
  \leq \sum_{i=1}^N\frac{\varepsilon}{N} = \varepsilon
\]
($g$ Absolutely Continuous) Again,fixing $\varepsilon$ and $N$, chose $\delta$ as in (\ref{q2b}). Then, we see that
\begin{align*}
    |f({b_i})-f({a_i})|^2 &\leq
\end{align*}

% Q3c
\item 

% Q3d
\item 
\begin{enumerate} 

% Q3d,i
\item 

% Q3d,ii 
\item We want to show $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ is not strongly absolutely continuous. To do so, suppose by contridiction that $f$ is strongly absolutely continuous. And without loss of generality, also suppose that $\varepsilon<1/2$ and that $\delta$ is chosen accordingly. We will now find a finite collection such that
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^N (b_i-a_i) < \delta
    \quad\text{but}\quad
    \sum_{i=1}^N |f(b_i)-f(a_i)| \geq \varepsilon 
\]
So, given $\delta$, construct a set of overlapping intervals 
\[
    \left\{\left(0,\frac{1}{(N+k)^2}\right)\right\}^N_{k=1}
\]
Now given this set, to choose $N$, we note that
\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{(N+k)^2} <  \frac{1}{N^2}  
    \quad\Rightarrow\quad
    \sum_{k=1}^N |b_i-a_i| &=
    \sum_{k=1}^N \left\lvert\frac{1}{(N+k)^2}-0\right\rvert \\
    &<\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{N^2}
     =N\cdot \frac{1}{N^2} = \frac{1}{N}
\end{align*}
So then just choose $N$ such that $1/N < \delta$. We now have our finite set of intervals. 

Next, let's look at result, using the fact that $\frac{1}{N+k} \geq \frac{1}{2N} $ for $k\leq N$. 
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{k=1}^N |f(b_i)-f(a_i)| = \sum_{k=1}^N 
    \left\lvert \sqrt{\frac{1}{(N+k)^2}} - \sqrt{0}\right\rvert
    &= \sum_{k=1}^N {\frac{1}{N+k}}  \\
    &\geq \sum_{k=1}^N {\frac{1}{2N}}  = N\cdot \frac{1}{2N} = \frac{1}{2}
\end{align*}
And we assumed that $\varepsilon<1/2$, so this is a contradiction.
