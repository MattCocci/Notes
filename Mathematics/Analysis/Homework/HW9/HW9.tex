\maketitle 

\begin{enumerate} 

% Question 1
\item Let $f$ be a function that is Lipschitz. We want to prove that it is absolutely continuous. So let $C$ and $\eta$ be non-negative constants such that that 
\begin{equation}
\label{lip}
    |x-y|<\eta
    \quad\Rightarrow\quad
    |f(x)-f(y)|<C|x-y|
\end{equation}
Then, fix $\varepsilon>0$ and choose $\delta$ such that
\begin{equation}
\label{q1.step}
    \sum_{i=1}^N|b_i-a_i| \leq 
    \delta := \frac{\min\{\varepsilon,\eta\}}{C}
\end{equation}
This choice of $\delta$ obviously implies that $(b_i-a_i)<\eta$ for all $i$. So 
now let's use that together with Condition \ref{lip} to bound the target sum by $\varepsilon$:
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^N |f(b_i)-f(a_i)| \leq 
    \sum_{i=1}^N C|b_i-a_i| &=
    C \sum_{i=1}^N |b_i-a_i| \\
    \text{By (\ref{q1.step})} \qquad
    &\leq 
    C \cdot \frac{\min\{\varepsilon,\eta\}}{C}
    = \min\{\varepsilon,\eta\}
\end{align*}
Clearly, the sum is bounded by $\varepsilon$.




% Question 2
\item 
\begin{enumerate} 

% Part a
\item Suppose that we have a composition $f\circ g$. We want to show that, for fixed $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta$ such that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q2a}
    \sum_{i=1}^N |b_i-a_i|<\delta 
    \quad\Rightarrow\quad
    \sum_{i=1}^N |f(g(b_i))-f(g(a_i))|<\varepsilon
\end{equation}
The ``obvious'' attempt says to, fixing $\varepsilon$, find the relevant $\delta_f$ for the function $f$ such that
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^N |b_i-a_i|<\delta_f
    \quad\Rightarrow\quad
    \sum_{i=1}^N |f(b_i)-f(a_i)|<\varepsilon
\]
Then, let this $\delta_f$ be the new $\varepsilon'$, and find $\delta_g$ for the function $g$ such that
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^N |b_i-a_i|<\delta_g
    \quad\Rightarrow\quad
    \sum_{i=1}^N |g(b_i)-g(a_i)|<\varepsilon' := \delta_f
\]
In a sense, this approach tries to control the size of the second sum in (\ref{q2a}) in two stages. We want the intervals to be sufficiently small such that, when mapped by $g$, the result will still be sufficiently small for when $f$ maps them.

% Part b
\item ($f$ Absolutely Continuous) Let $\varepsilon$ and $N$ (the number of disjoint intervals) be given. Then choose $\delta$ such that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q2b}
    \delta:= \varepsilon^2
\end{equation}
Then, we see that 
\begin{align*}
    \left(\sum_{i=1}^N
    |f({b_i})-f({a_i})|\right)^2 \leq 
    \sum_{i=1}^N
    |f({b_i})-f({a_i})|^2 
    &\leq
    \sum_{i=1}^N
    \left(\sqrt{b_i}-\sqrt{a_i}\right)\left(\sqrt{b_i}+\sqrt{a_i}\right)  \\
    &\leq \sum_{i=1}^N b_i - a_i < \delta := {\varepsilon^2} \\
    \Rightarrow\quad
    \sum_{i=1}^n|f({b_i})-f({a_i})|^2 &\leq {\varepsilon^2} \\
    \Leftrightarrow\quad
    \sum_{i=1}^n|f({b_i})-f({a_i})| &\leq {\varepsilon} 
\end{align*}
($g$ Absolutely Continuous) I think $g$ is Lipschitz, in which  case you could use part 1, but I had trouble showing that.

The alternative is to split up the domain so that the endpoints of the intervals map to peaks and troughs of the sin function, then bound the difference $f(b_i)-f(a_i)$ by approximating $\sin(1/b_i)=1$ and $sin(1/a_i)=-1$, then get a bound. But this didn't work out for me.

($f\circ g$ not AC) I'd imagine you also want to use the peaks and troughs of the sin functions, then choose $N$ large enough so that the intervals are small, then show that the sum of the differences of the function at the endpoints still exceeds $\varepsilon$.


% Q3c
\item The flaw in (a)'s reasoning comes in neglecting the possibility that the function $g$ in $f\circ g$ might turn disjoint intervals into non-disjoint intervals. As hinted at, the definition is for disjoint intervals, and that is crucial.

To give an example, take $f$ and $g$ in part (b). Then note that the $\sin\frac{1}{x}$ has its maxima and minima at $\left\{\frac{2}{(4k+1)\pi}\right\}_0^\infty$ and $\left\{\frac{2}{(4k+3)\pi}\right\}_0^\infty$, respectively. So let's take disjoint intervals in $[0,1]$ to be
\[
    (a_1,b_1) = \left(\frac{2}{3\pi}, \frac{2}{\pi}\right)
    \qquad
    (a_2,b_2) = \left(\frac{2}{7\pi}, \frac{2}{5\pi}\right)
\]
Then, mapping these intervals with $g$, we see that we get overlapping intervals as a result:
\begin{align*}
    g((a_1,b_1)) = \left(\frac{4}{9\pi^2}, \frac{12}{\pi^2}\right)
    \approx (0.045, 1.215)\\
    g((a_2,b_2)) = \left(\frac{4}{49\pi^2}, 
    \frac{12}{25\pi^2}\right)
    \approx (0.008, 0.049)
\end{align*}
So we see that $g$ doesn't preserve the disjointness of the intervals when it's time to apply $f$ to get $f\circ g$.


% Q3d
\item 
\begin{enumerate} 

% Q3d,i
\item Suppose that the functions $f$ and $g$ are strongly absolutely continuous. Letting $\varepsilon>0$ be given, we want to show that $f\circ g$ is strongly absolutely continuous, i.e. we can choose a $\delta$ such that 
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=1}^N |b_i-a_i|<\delta_{f\circ g}
    \quad\Rightarrow\quad
    \sum_{i=1}^N |f(g(b_i))-f(g(a_i))|<\varepsilon
\end{equation}
So, we'll take the ``obvious'' approach from part (a), which will work here for the reasons explained in part (c). So, since $f$ is absolutely continuous, there exists a $\delta_f$ such that
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=1}^N |p_i-q_i|<\delta_f
    \quad\Rightarrow\quad
    \sum_{i=1}^N |f(p_i)-f(q_i)|<\varepsilon
\end{equation}
where $\{(q_i,p_i)\}_1^N$ is \emph{any} finite collection of intervals. Next, we can use the fact that $g$ is strongly absolutely continuous to choose a $\delta_g$ such that
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=1}^N |b_i-a_i|<\delta_g
    \quad\Rightarrow\quad
    \sum_{i=1}^N |g(b_i)-g(a_i)|<\delta_f
\end{equation}
Now setting our overall $\delta_{g\circ f}:=\delta_g$, we see that for any set of intervals $\{(a_i, b_i)\}$
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^N |b_i-a_i|<\delta_g
    &\quad\Rightarrow\quad
    \sum_{i=1}^N |g(b_i)-g(a_i)|<\delta_f \\
    &\quad\Rightarrow\quad
    \sum_{i=1}^N |f(g(b_i))-f(g(a_i))|<\varepsilon
\end{align*}
where $\{(g(a_i),g(b_i)\}^N_1$ is a finite collection of open intervals for $f$.

% Q3d,ii 
\item We want to show $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ is not strongly absolutely continuous. To do so, suppose by contradiction that $f$ is strongly absolutely continuous. And without loss of generality, also suppose that $\varepsilon<1/2$ and that $\delta$ is chosen accordingly. We will now find a finite collection such that
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^N (b_i-a_i) < \delta
    \quad\text{but}\quad
    \sum_{i=1}^N |f(b_i)-f(a_i)| \geq \varepsilon 
\]
So, given $\delta$, construct a set of overlapping intervals 
\[
    \left\{\left(0,\frac{1}{(N+k)^2}\right)\right\}^N_{k=1}
\]
Now given this set, to choose $N$, we note that
\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{(N+k)^2} <  \frac{1}{N^2}  
    \quad\Rightarrow\quad
    \sum_{k=1}^N |b_i-a_i| &=
    \sum_{k=1}^N \left\lvert\frac{1}{(N+k)^2}-0\right\rvert \\
    &<\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{N^2}
     =N\cdot \frac{1}{N^2} = \frac{1}{N}
\end{align*}
So then just choose $N$ such that $1/N < \delta$. We now have our finite set of intervals. 

Next, let's look at result, using the fact that $\frac{1}{N+k} \geq \frac{1}{2N} $ for $k\leq N$. 
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{k=1}^N |f(b_i)-f(a_i)| = \sum_{k=1}^N 
    \left\lvert \sqrt{\frac{1}{(N+k)^2}} - \sqrt{0}\right\rvert
    &= \sum_{k=1}^N {\frac{1}{N+k}}  \\
    &\geq \sum_{k=1}^N {\frac{1}{2N}}  = N\cdot \frac{1}{2N} = \frac{1}{2}
\end{align*}
And we assumed that $\varepsilon<1/2$, so this is a contradiction. 


% Part q3d, iii
\item To show that Lipschitz implies strongly absolutely continuous, note that the proof given in Question 1 in now way depended upon the disjointness of the intervals. It was entirely formulated in terms of the \emph{lengths} of the intervals being sufficiently small. 

So as long as we set $\delta$ as in Equation \ref{q1.step}, we get the desired result.

% Part q3d, iv
\item To show strongly absolutely continuous implies Lipschitz, let $\varepsilon=1$ and let $\delta_0$ be the corresponding $\delta$. Next if $|u-v|<\delta_0$, let $N=\left\lfloor{\frac{\delta_0}{|u-v|}}\right\rfloor$ and form the finite set of open intervals
\[
    \{(a_k,b_k)\}_1^N
    = \{(\min(u,v),\max(u,v))\}_1^N
\]
Note that for all $k$ and $j$, $(a_k,b_k)=(a_j,b_j)$ and $b_k-a_k=|u-v|$. 
\\
\\
Next, it's clear that
\begin{equation}
\label{q2div}
    \sum_{k=1}^N |b_k-a_k| =
    \sum_{k=1}^N |u-v|  = N|u-v| =
    \left\lfloor{\frac{\delta_0}{|u-v|}}\right\rfloor
    |u-v|
\end{equation}
Now it's not so straightforward to work with the floor of a fraction, but note that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{q2div.trick}
    \left\lfloor{\frac{\delta_0}{|u-v|}}\right\rfloor|u-v|
    \leq \frac{\delta_0}{|u-v|}|u-v| = \delta_0
\end{equation}
So we've bounded (\ref{q2div}) by $\delta_0$, which allows us to conclude that
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=k}^N |f(b_k)-f(a_k)|
    = \sum_{i=k}^N |f(u)-f(v)| &< 1 \\
    \Rightarrow\quad
    N |f(u)-f(v)| &< 1
\end{align*}
Now from there, let's recall our expression for $N$:
\begin{align*}
    N |f(u)-f(v)|  = 
    \left\lfloor{\frac{\delta_0}{|u-v|}}\right\rfloor
    \cdot |f(u)-f(v)| &< 1 \\
    \Leftrightarrow\quad
    |f(u)-f(v)|
    &< \left(
    \left\lfloor{\frac{\delta_0}{|u-v|}}\right\rfloor\right)^{-1}
\end{align*}
But now, we can say
\begin{align*}
    |f(u)-f(v)|
    &< \left(
    \left\lfloor{\frac{\delta_0}{|u-v|}}\right\rfloor\right)^{-1}
    \leq 
    \left(\frac{\delta_0}{2|u-v|}\right)^{-1}
    = \frac{2}{\delta_0}|u-v|
\end{align*}
So $f$ is Lipschitz. Also, note that the substitution we did in the last line, where we multiplied the denominator of the non-floored fraction by 2 is valid for the following reason. 
\\
\\
Next, we need only consider $|u-v|<\delta_0$ because if $|u-v|\geq\delta_0$ break up the interval. Specifically, suppose without loss of generality, that $u<v$. Then we can partition $[u,v]$ into a finite collection of $M$ segments $[u_i, v_i]$ each with total length less than $\delta_0$, allowing us to apply the Lipschitz condition for those segments.  So we can use the triangle inequality
\[
    |f(v)-f(u)| \leq \sum_{i=1}^M |f(v_i)-f(u_i)| \leq \sum_{i=1}^M C|v_i-u_i| 
    \leq C(v-u)
\]

% Question 3
\item For a monotone function $f:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, we want to show that $f$ can be written as $g+h$ where $g$ is absolutely continuous and $h'=0$ almost everywhere. To do so, note that as a monotone function $f$ has countably many points of discontinuity (proven in an older homework) so that $f$ is continuous almost everywhere over a compact domain $[a,b]$, implying $f$ is Lebesgue integrable. Moreover, since $f$ is monotonic, it is differentiable almost everywhere (also proved before), so look at 
\[
    g(x) = \int_{[a,x]} f'\; dm 
\]
By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus I for Lebesgue, we know that $g$ is absolutely continuous. But then we can write $f=g + (f-g)$.
