Basic Idea
===========
The axiom of choice says if you have a collection C of nonempty subsets, then we can choose a member from each set in that collection.

More Formally
==============
There exists a function f on C such that, for each S in C, we have f(S) in S. 

Controversy
============
This seems like a real no-brainer. Why name it, and why talk about something that's so obvious?

Well, there was a controversy about that choice function, f.Namely, how you interpret "choose" and "find" impacts your interpretation of the axiom.

For most mathematicians, if you say "there exists a choice function f", you don't necessarily need to provide it or be able to construct it. You're just saying it does hypothetically exist, but you don't need to write it down to apply the axiom of choice. Just arbitrarily pick elements of the sets S in C to set as f(S).

But some people have a problem with that. Some mathematicians interpret "exists" as meaning "you can write it down." This is where the problem comes in, because you might not be able to do so. One possible case is the collection of all nonempty subsets of the real line, where it's not at all clear how to write a choice function (and you might not even be able to).
