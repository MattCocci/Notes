The goal of this directory is to bring together disparate notes
and resources on a few important topics.  For example, a folder
on "Simple Regression" might begin with a simple derivation following
a mathematical statistics mindset and approach.  Thereafter, the
note on simple regression might discuss how to calculate the optimal
parameter estimates not through matrix algebra, but through 
an optimization problem before concluding with a Bayesian treatment
of the topic.

By design, the topics will include important foundational concepts
that often permit many different routes to understanding or deriving
the primary results.
