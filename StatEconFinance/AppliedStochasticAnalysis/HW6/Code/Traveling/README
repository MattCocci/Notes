The program Traveling_Main.m is the main program that calls everything
else. It does the following:
1. Call Travling_Data.m to load the data
2. Loop over iterations, calling Travling_MHStep to accept or reject new
   paths.
3. Plot distances and display acceptances ratios (code directly in
   Traveling_Main.m).
4. Write sample paths with Traveling_PlotTrip.m so that
   Traveling_PlotTrip.R can plot a sample path.
