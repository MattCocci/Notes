  Discrete time generator assumption
    p_ij(h) = λ_ij h + o(h)       j=/=i
    p_ij(h) = 1 - λ_ij h + o(h)   j==i
  P(t) = e^{Qt}
  Backward Eqn
    dv/dt = Qv      u_0^{(k)} = f(k)
  Forward Eqn

  Mean First Passage time
    Qτ = -1
  Stationary distribution
    πQ = 0
  If Q irreducible, then a stationary distribution is unique (if it
    exists), and you'll go there

  *Question 4 and spectral garbage
  Conditions for SDE solution uniqueness
    - Global lipschitz: |b(x,t) - b(y,t)| + |s(x,t)-s(y,t)| < K|x-y|
  Conditions for SDE solution existence
    - Satisfy linear growth conds: |b(x,t)| + |s(x,t)| < K|1+|x||
  Ito to Stratanovich
    - Subtract from drift: (1/2) * ds/dx : s
  Stratanovich to Ito
    - Add to drift: (1/2) * ds/dx : s
  For BM on a circle, just remember the deterministic case, x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 1
  Stratanovich chain rule can be useful
  For solving simple Ito integrals, multiply through by e^{f(t)} so that
    df/dt matches the part of the drift that is a fcn of t
  Integrating Factor: Use the solution for the determistic part
  Chain Rule
    d(AX) = A dX + X dA + dX dA

Homework 9
  Euler Maruyama: Simple updating
  Milstein: Tack on  + (1/2) s * ds/dx (dW^2 - dt)
  Runge-Kutta: Numerical derivative
  Quality of Approximation:
    - consistency: local discretization error -> 0 with order >= 1
    - convergence: global error -> 0
    - stability: converges to same long-time states as exact soln
  Strong and weak forms for each
    - Strong convergence: pathwise; where Y is approx of X

        max_t E(Y_t - X_t)^2 <= C (dt)^(2a)

      order a. Must use same BM for all, since pathwise.

    - Weak convergence: prob distr; where Y is approx of X and f is a fcn

        max_t |E[f(Y_t)] - E[X_t]|^2 <= C (dt)^(2b)

      order b. C can depend on f, not dt. Can use diff BM.
  Soln X_t = 0 mean square stable if lim_t->oo EX_t^2 = 0 where X_t is
    GBM with given mu and sigma
  Asymptotically stable if P(lim_t->oo |X_t| = 0) = 1

Homework 10
  Lf  = b ∇f   + (1/2) ss^T  : ∆f     = lim_t->oo [ E[f(Xt)|X0] - f(x) ] / t
  L*f = -∇(bf) + (1/2) ∆(ff) : ∆(af)

  They are adjoints so ∫ Lf g dμ = ∫ f L*g dμ

  Backward Eqn
    - du/dt = Lu          u(x,t) = E[f(X_t)     | X_0=x]
    - dv/ds + Lu = 0      v(y,s) = E[f(X_t) = y | X_s]
    - dp/ds + L_x p = 0   p(y,t|x,s) = δ(x-y)

  Forward Equation
    - dp/dt = L*_y p      p(y,t|x,s)

  Forward Equation / Fokker-Planck
    - dρ/dt = L*ρ         ρ(x,0)

  Boundary Conditions for Fokker-Planck
    - j = bρ - 0.5 ∇(aρ)
    - Reflecting: j∙n = 0
    - Absorbing:  ρ = 0
    - Periodic:  j|b = j|a,  ρ|b = ρ|a

  Finish Homeworks 8-12 and review
    Left off at Question 6a, homework 8
  Discrete time generators
  Karhunen-Loeve and Spectral



  Note that the ij entry of ss^T = sum_j s_ij * s_ij
  Note that A : B = tr(A^T B) = sum_i,j a_ij b_ij



Concepts
  Strongly Stationary
    All fdds are invariant to time shifts
  Weakly Stationary
    Mean and Covariance invariant to time shifts

Remember
  C(0) > C(h) for all h
  If C(t) for weakly stationary process cts at 0, then unif cts for all t
  C(t) cts at 0 iff X_t cts in L2 sense
  Ergodic Theorem for stationary processes:
    The time-ave of a weakly stationary process will converge to its mean



Spectral Analysis
  If C(t) is the cov fcn of weakly stnry X_t, and C(t) is cts at 0, then
    there is a spectral measure
  When computing S(\lambda) remember 2 things:
    1/2pi out front
    Negative exponent
  You might be able to throw out parts of the frequency domain



Generators and Operators
  - Get a listing of all the shit I can get from generators
  - We can get to the eigenfunctions of L* by taking

    psi_lambda = p_s * phi_lambda

    where psi_lambda is an eigenfunction of L* with eigenval lambda,
    while phi_lambda is the corresponding eigenfcn of L. p_s is the
    stationary dist


Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
  dX_t = -aX_t dt + s dW_t
  EX_t = e^{-at} EX_0
  Var(X_infty) = s2/(2a)

Geometric Brownian Motion
  dX_t = u X_t dt + s X_t dW_t
  X_t  = X_0 exp( (r-s2/2)t + sW_t )
