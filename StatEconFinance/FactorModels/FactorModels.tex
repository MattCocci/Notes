\section{Key Result for Factor Models}

The conditional distribution of jointly multivariate normal random variables is
one of the most important results that underlies the estimation and application
of factor, regression, and state space models. It can be summarized as follows:
\begin{align}
  \text{Given} \qquad 
    \begin{bmatrix} X_1 \\ X_2 \end{bmatrix}
    &\sim 
    N\left(
    \begin{bmatrix} \mu_1 \\ \mu_2 \end{bmatrix},
    \begin{bmatrix} 
      \Sigma_{11} & \Sigma_{12} \\
      \Sigma_{21} & \Sigma_{22} 
    \end{bmatrix} 
    \right) \notag\\
    \label{reg} \\
  X_1 | X_2 &\sim N(\hat{\mu}, \hat{\Sigma})  \notag\\
  \text{where} \quad
  \hat{\mu} &= \mu_1 + \Sigma_{12} \Sigma^{-1}_{22} 
    (X_2-\mu_2) \notag\\
  \hat{\Sigma} &= \Sigma_{11} - \Sigma_{12} \Sigma^{-1}_{22} 
    \Sigma_{21}\notag
\end{align}
This will be used again and again to derive the results presented below.

\section{Factor Models without Dynamics}

To begin with the simplest case, this section considers factor models
without dynamics, ignoring any autocorrelation between observations even
when dealing with time series data.

\subsection{General Case}

Suppose that we have data $\{X_{it}\}$ for $i=1,\ldots,n$ and
$t=1,\ldots,T$. In economics, this will often be a panel dataset, with
individuals or data series along the $i$ dimension and time across the
$t$ dimension. However, the model presented below could just as well
characterize any dataset that varies along two dimensions.\footnote{For
example, factor analysis was developed early on to extract certain
components of intelligence (general intelligence, verbal intelligence,
analytical intelligence, etc.) that explain the types of questions that
people answer correctly and how often they answer correctly. In that
case, you have $T$ individuals answering $n$ different questions that
test a range of abilities.  Then, the $X_{it}$ would be variables
denoting whether individual $t$ got question $i$ right, and you could
extract common factors across individuals which correspond to these
different types of intelligence.}

The data $\{X_{it}\}$ are assumed to be explained by $r$ factors,
$\{f_j\}_{j=1}^r$, plus random error. 
\begin{equation}
  X_{it} = \mu_i + \lambda_{i1} f_{1t} + \cdots + \lambda_{ir} f_{rt} + e_{it}
  \qquad i=1\ldots,n
\end{equation}
where errors are orthogonal to errors (across $i$ and $t$) and factors
are orthogonal to factors (across $r$ and $t$).

We can write out the model more explicitly and compactly in matrix
notation.  To do so, we stack all ovservations for a given $t$ and write
out the distributional assumptions as:
\begin{align}
  \underset{(n \times 1)}{X_t} &= \underset{(n \times 1)}{\mu} + 
    \underset{(n \times r)}{\Lambda} \underset{(r \times 1)}{F_t}
    + \underset{(n \times 1)}{e_t} 
    \qquad\quad \text{with } F_t \perp e_t
    \notag\\
  \begin{bmatrix} X_{1t} \\ \vdots \\ X_{nt} \end{bmatrix}
    &= \begin{bmatrix} \mu_{1t} \\ \vdots \\ \mu_{rt} \end{bmatrix}+
        \begin{bmatrix} 
          \lambda_{11} & \cdots & \lambda_{1r} \\
          \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
          \lambda_{n1} & \cdots & \lambda_{nr} 
        \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix} f_{1t} \\ \vdots \\ f_{rt} \end{bmatrix}
      +  \begin{bmatrix} e_{1t} \\ \vdots \\ e_{nt} \end{bmatrix}
      \label{fm} \\\notag\\
  \text{Where} \qquad
    \begin{bmatrix} e_t \\ F_t \end{bmatrix} &\sim
    N\left(
      \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} ,
      \begin{bmatrix} 
        \Psi & 0 \\
        0 & I \\
      \end{bmatrix}
      \right)\notag
\end{align}
where $\Psi$ is a diagonal matrix, and where the \emph{loading matrix}
$\Lambda$ is not necessarily square (though it may look like it above).
