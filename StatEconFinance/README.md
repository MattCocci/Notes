CONTENTS
=============

AssetPricing
-------------

Notes to John Cochrane's Coursera "Asset Pricing" course.
     
BayesianStatistics
--------------------

Notes from my Bayesian Statistics class. Includes
notes on MCMC, basic Bayesian Models, the Gibb Sampler,
etc.

BetaDistribution
-------------------

Profile of the Beta Distribution: pdf, moments, etc.

ChiSquareDistribution
-----------------------

Profile of the Chi-Square distribution: it's 
motivation as the square of normal random variable, it's
density, and some properties and uses of the distribution.

ContinuousTimeFinance
-----------------------

Notes to my Mathematical Finance class. Covers the Ito
Calculus, the construction of the Ito Integral, the
construction of Brownian Motion, Stochastic Differential
Equations, etc.

Convergence
-----------------

Covers the different types of convergence in probability
along with some associated concepts such as consistency
and efficiency.

CreditDerivatives
-------------------

From my Financial Engineering class.


DerivativeTypes
------------------

A list of the different types of derivatives. In 
particular this note lists the payoff schemes for
different derivative types.  Together with a model
of asset price movements, these payoff schemes
determine the value of an asset today.


DiscreteSpaceContinuousTimeFinance
-----------------------------------

Covers jump processes, the Chapman-Kolmogorov Equation,
and Forward Equations.


Econometrics
--------------

Traditional econometrics.


EquityDerivatives
------------------

Covers models associated with pricing equity derivatives:
Black-Scholes, Stochastic Volatility Models, etc.


FixedIncomeDerivatives
-----------------------

Covers models associated with pricing Fixed Income
derivatives, including models of the term structure,
model of the short rate, etc.


GammaDistribution
-------------------

Overview of the Gamma Distribution: its pdf, the moments,
its relation to Chi-Squared and Exponential random 
variables.


InterestRateModels
-------------------

Models of interest rate evolution.


KalmanFilter
--------------


MachineLearning
-----------------

Based on the Coursera Machine Learning course.


MarkovChains
-------------

Markov Chains, transition matrices, Chapman-Kolmogorov 
Equations, stationary distributions, uniform ergodicity,
and an application to Google's PageRank algorithm.


MathematicalStatistics
-----------------------

Notes from my mathematical statistics class.  Covers
- Parameter Bias
- Order Statistics
- Cramer-Rao Inequality
- Sufficient Statistics
- Rao-Blackwell Theorem
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation
- Transformation Theory
- Hypothesis Testing
- Non-Parametric Statistics


MeasureTheory
-------------

Covers the very basics of measure theory.  Exposes just
enough to give some grounding to probability theory
(and stochastic calculus in particular).


MostlyHarmlessEconometrics
---------------------------

Econometrics notes based on the book Mostly Harmless
Econometrics.


MultivariateNormal
--------------------

Describes the multivariate normal distribution: its
pdf, its characteristics, and the intuition. The note 
goes on to derive the distribution of linear 
transformations of a Multivariate Normal RV. It then
explores linear Gaussian recurrence relations before
concluding with a description of the Cholesky 
decomposition in the appendix.


Optimization
--------------


Regression
------------


TimeSeries
-----------

Covers the basics of univariate time series. (VARs are
covered in a separate note.)


VARs
-----

Covers Vector Autoregressions, with special treatment
of Bayesian VARs for economic applications.  Describes
the Minnesota Prior along with structural VARs.
