\section{Introduction}

\section{Canonical Problem: The System of Linear Equations under the Row and Column Interpretations}

Linear algebra's founding problem is likely the task of solving the simple system of linear equations:
\begin{equation}
    \label{canonical}
    Ax = b
\end{equation}
For now, assume $A$ is $p\times p$. There are two ways to think of this equation:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\sl Row Interpretation}: We think of each row in the equation as defining a line in $p$ dimensional place. The solution is where those lines intersect.
    \item {\sl Column Interpretation}: A solution to the equation exists if and only if $b$ is in the column space of $A$. More explicitly, there is a solution if and only if $b$ can be written as a linear combination of the $p$ vectors defined by the columns of $A$.
\end{enumerate}
The latter interpretation is very powerful. We see that the column space of $A$---the set of all linear combinations of the columns of $A$---is crucial to characterizing the matrix $A$. 

For example, if the columns of $A$ are linearly independent, then the matrix, in a sense, ``covers'' the entire $p$-dimensional space. We can thus solve \emph{any} equation like Equation \ref{canonical} because $b$ will certainly lie within the column space of $A$. Thus, we can find some $x$ such that $Ax=b$. 

We only potentially run into problems if the columns aren't linearly independent. So if the rank of the matrix is $k<p$, only a $k$-dimensional hyperplance embedded within $\mathbb{R}^p$ is covered by the columns of $A$. And $b$ might not lie in that subspace. This very possibility manifests itself in the non-invertability of $A$, which prevents us from trivially solving the system via $x = A^{-1}b$, for the very reasons just discussed.


\section{Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues}
\section{The Singular Value Decomposition}

\subsection{Intuition}

The intuition for the singular value decomposition comes down to simply notions like stretching and rotating. So we'll start with very simple examples, then consider increasingly complicated and general matrices.
\\
\\
{\sl Diagonal Matrix}: So to begin, consider any diagonal matrix:
\[ 
    A = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        a_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
        0 & a_2 & \cdots & 0 \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        0 & 0 & \cdots & a_n \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \quad 
    \Rightarrow 
    \quad 
    Ax = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 x_1 \\ a_2 x_2 \\ \vdots \\
        a_n x_n \end{pmatrix}
\]
It's quite clear that if $x$ is vector, the result of the product $Ax$ is merely a \emph{stretched} version of $x$. The $i$th coordinate, $x_i$, is simply stretched by $a_i$ along the $i$th axis. If we consider the map and vector
\[
    A = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}
    \qquad x =\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1  \end{pmatrix}
\]
we see what happens when we apply $A$ to $x$:

{\sl Symmetric Matrix}: Next, suppose that instead of having $A$ diagonal, it is (more generally) just symmetric so that $A^T = A$. Thus, $A$ will have $n$ eigenvalues and eigenvectors, where the eigenvectors are also orthogonal.\footnote{This is a property of symmetric matrices.} Now why does this matter? 

At first blush, since $A$ isn't symmetric, we've lost the interpretation about $A$ stretching each coordinate of a vector along an axis. \emph{However}, it so happens that the eigenvectors (by definition) define special axes along which vectors are stretched when multiplied by $A=A^T$. Just as a diagonal matrix \emph{stretches} each vector coordinate in the direction of its corresponding Cartesian axis, so too does a symmetric matrix \emph{stretch} each vector coordinate along a special axis defined by the eigenvectors. Note the degree of stretching is determined by the corresponding eigenvalue for an eigenvector axis. 

So we see that symmetric matrices are akin to diagonal matrices;
up to a rotation of the axes \emph{from} the usual Cartesian basis \emph{to} a special basis defined by the eigenvectors.




\section{Principal Component Analysis}
\subsection{Overview}

Principal Component Analysis is a type of \emph{feature extraction}
that takes a number of ``features'' or independent variables, then 
uses them in combination to build and rank new variables which 
explain the largest share of variability in some response (or
dependent) variable. This differs from \emph{feature selection}
which takes a list of features and selects a subset to use as is
(free of any combination or modification).

Principal Component Analysis can also be used to combat the 
\emph{curse of dimensionality}.  Loosely speaking, this technical
problem arises when you have many features or independent variables
that might explain some dependent variable. As the number of 
features grows, the data becomes ever sparser in a higher 
dimensional space.\footnote{Say that an outcome $y$ is dependent
upon the roll of $N$ dice, $\{x_1, \ldots, x_N\}$. As $N$ increases, 
there are exponentially more outcomes that might 
result--$6^N$ to be precise. So as $N$ increases, the space within 
which the data lives grows exponentially, which necessitates 
exponentially larger samples to match the explanatory power you
would have in dimensions with lower $N$.}
Principal Component Analysis can be used to combine features, rank
them in order or importance, and throw out features that don't
explain much variance in the dependent variable.


\subsection{Intuition}

Principal Component Analysis really just finds new ways
to look at the data by changing the axes.  Imagine we had
the following data.

PCA highlights the fact that there is nothing sacred
about the axes I have drawn there.  We can express the
data points relative to a new set of axes so that the
variation along different dimensions is more explicit. In
linear algebra terminology, we can use another \emph{basis}.
