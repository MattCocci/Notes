This folder houses various notes, cheat sheets, and reference docs
from classes and online sources. The files synced to github will
primarily include tex files that I write along with txt files designed
to be quick references for programming and computing. Complied PDF files
of tex notes are available for download, although I don't think they
can be viewed within a browser.
