-------- Simple Terminal Stuff ---------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------


	----- Basics ------------------------------------------------

	ctrl-z 	stops foreground process
	ctrl-c 	kills foreground process
	; 			allows multiple commands on the same line
	*			wildcard; expands into all the filenames in
					directory, when used alone can also be used
					within path names	when used with other
					characters, it will expand * into all files
					whose names include the character pattern
					surrounding the *
	? 			wildcard; identical to *, EXCEPT it can only expand
					into EXACTLY one char


	----- Input, Output, Pipes ----------------------------------

	< 		redirects input from file into a program
	> 		redirects output from a program into a file
	>>		redirects output from a program and append on to the
				end of a file

	cmd1 | cmd2		pipes output from cmd1 as input to cmd2


	----- Various Useful Terminal Commands ----------------------

	echo				repeats whatever comes after
	jobs
	fg					bring ctrl + z'd jobs back to foreground
	bg
	chmod
	su					enter sudo mode
	which prgm 		finds where a program (like prgm) lives on a
							filesystem
	alias				example: ..="cd .." will make .. execute cd ..;
							Can put alias statements in the .bashrc in
							the home directory to make aliasing happen
							automatically
	ls -l				give a detailed list of files
	ls -a				show all files, even hidden files
	ps					displays which processes are currently running



	----- tar, archives, compression ----------------------------

	tar 	combines a directory structure into a single file,
				a "tarball"
			used for distributing file heirarchies
			also supports compression with "gzip" and "bzip2"

	-c 	creates a new archive file
	-x 	extract files from archive
	-t 	list files in an archive
	-f 	specify archive file to create or extract from;
				automatically uses * if -x or -t and no -f
				specified; tar reads from standard input in
				(aka stdin)
	-z 	compress with gzip
	-j 	compress with bzip2

	Examples of use:
		create: 			tar -cvf archive.tar file1 file2 ...
		extract:			tar -xvf archive.tar
		list contents:	tar -tvf archive.tar

	Compression
		gzip
		bzip2
		7z

	Compression Example
		7z a archive.7z files




----------------------------------------------------------------
-------- Shell Scripting ---------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------

	To run a script:
		sh script.sh
		source script.sh
		sript.sh
			--after changing file permission to x w/ chmod


	The Script Header:
	#!/bin/sh		or
	#!/bin/bash		#! must start each shell script file to
							signify that it is a script file; the
							/bin/sh or /bin/bash specifies the way to
							the interpreter for the script; use sh for
							generic script; bash for bash-specific
							scripts; we could use #!/bin/perl for perl
							scripts

	#					the comment symbol
	strings			the basic unit for shell scripting
	read input		when used in a script, prompts the user for
							input that can then be referenced as a
							variable later



	----- Variables and Assignment ------------------------------
	=		assignment operator
	$varname	after assignment of a string to varname, this
			    outputs the value assigned to variable
	Single quotes	prevents the shell from performing variable
			    substitution (which you'll need for $ signs
			    because $var for unassigned variable, var,
			    will output the empty string, while '$var'
			    outputs $var)
	Double quotes	still allows variable substitution, and allows
			    spaces to be used in variable assignment
	$()		put commands inside the () and the shell will
			    replace that with the text output of the
			    commands; works inside double quotes, not
			    single quotes




	----- Arguments ---------------------------------------------
	Allow users to pass dynamic info to script and specify how to
		behave

	Example: 	sh script.sh arg1 arg2

	$0		used to reference the name of the script
	$n		where n=1,...,9 references the first nine arguments;
				use ${m} where m>=10
	$* 	gives one string with all arguments passed to script
	$# 	gives the number of arguments passed to the script




	----- Functions ---------------------------------------------
	Heavy duty version of alias; two ways to do it:
		fun_name (){ body }
		function fun_name { body }

	$*, $n, ${m} 	used within body to access function argments,
			    just like references within scripts
	local loc_var	placed within body; makes loc_var a local
			    variable within the fn




	----- Conditionals ------------------------------------------
	All programs return an exit status from 0-255 when they
		terminate

	$?					The exit status gets stored as this special
							variables
	0					This exit status signals a successful/clean
							exit;	anything other values indicate
							failure
	true/false		Recall, bash treats all variables as strings,
							so no built-in true/false; instead, 0
							signifies true; anything else signals
							false
	exit code		within a script, returns statuscode "code"
	return code		within a function, returns statuscode "code"


	BASIC SYNTAX:
		if condition1
		then
			commands1
		elif condition2
		then
			commands2
		elif condition3
		then
			commands3
		...
		else
			# This else-statement is optional
			final commands
		fi



	----- Condition Tests ---------------------------------------
	Basic Form: 	[ condtion ]
			#spaces after & before "[" and "]" required

	[ str1 = str2 ]		tests equality
	[ str1 != str2 ]	tests inequality
	[ -z str ]		tests whether str is empty
	[ -n str ]		tests whether the string is non-null
	[ str1 \< str2 ]	tests (alphabetically) if str1 < str2
				    where the \ is an escape character



	----- File Test Operations ----------------------------------

	[ -x file ]

	-x	 	tests whether:
	--------------------------------
	-e 	file exists
	-d 	file is adirectory
	-r		file has read permissions
	-O		you own the file




	----- for Loops ---------------------------------------------

	Basic form:
		for i in list
			# list is a series of strings separated by spaces,
				# tabs, or newline characters
			# i is then a variable that can be used
		do
			commands
		done


	Over quoted strings (for i in "a b" c "d e f"):
		groupings by quotes (" ") preserved

	Over arguments	passed to script:
		if we use $* (all args) as the list, groupings not
			preserved
		if we loop over "$@" (quotes neceessary), groupings in
			arguments passed to script are preserved




	----- while Loops -------------------------------------------

	Basic Form:
		while [ condition ]
		do
			body
		done



	while-read-loops: Can be used to iterate over each line
		in a file

	Example:		while read var
					do
						body
					done < iterate.txt

	Ctrl+D		terminates a while-read-loop
	<				can be used to supply input to a while-read-loop,
						feeding in each line of iterate.txt
	break			can break a while loop
	continue		will cause the script to move to the next
						while-loop iteration without executing what
						comes below the continue appearance



	----- case Statement ----------------------------------------
	allows a script to choose one of multiple different blocks
		of code depending on whether the value matches a specific
		pattern
	an alternative, usually more succinct, to if/else/elif statments


	Basic Form:
		case value in
		pattern1)
			block1 ;;
		pattern2)
			block2 ;;
		...
		*) 			#In case value doesn't match any pattern above
			bock3 ;;
		esac




	----- Arithmetic --------------------------------------------

	$(( ))	Any expression placed inside will be interpreted as
					an arithmetic expression, and the result will be
					output

	[ num1 -lt num2 ]		tests if num1 <  num2
	[ num1 -gt num2 ]		tests if num1 >  num2
	[ num1 -le num2 ]		tests if num1 <= num2
	[ num1 -ge num2 ]		tests if num1 >= num2
	[ num1 -lt num2 ]		tests if num1 <  num2
	[ num1 -eq num2 ]		tests if num1 =  num2
	[ num1 -ne num2 ]		tests if num1 != num2





----------------------------------------------------------------
-------- Regular Expressions -----------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------

	grep		used to search for lines of text that contain
					a specific string, searches for lines of text
					that contain a specific string
	egrep		equivalent to grep -E, which provides extended
					regex support for grep


	Basic form: egrep -x 'expression' directory

	-x 	Description
	-------------------
	-i		ignore case
	-o		print only portion of the line that matches the regex
	-w		only matches lines that contain an entire word that
				matches the expression (so 'john' wouldn't match
				'johnny' with this option)
	-c		replaces normal egrep output with number that reports
				the number of lines containing matching strings


	Regexes
	------------------
	.		Matches exactly one character (any type), like ? in
				the shell
	*		Greedy matcher; matches zero to infinity of the
				preceding character,	so 'x*' matches '', 'x',
				'xx', etc.
	.*		Matches anything
	()		Can group characters together, so '(chars)*' checks
				for zero to infinity of 'chars'
	+		Greedy matcher; matches 1 to infinity of the preceding
				character; so a little tougher than *
	? 		Greedy matcher; matches 0 or 1 of the preceding
				character

	Greedy matching: tries to match the largest possible string
		that fits the expression, even if that spans multiple
		words and you only want one word


	Regex Character Classes
	-----------------------
	[x]		If "x" is a string of characters, this bracket
					notation (denoting a "character class") specifies
					a range of characters from which any character
					inside the brackets is considered a	match
	[^x]		If "x" is a string of characters, then the ^
					negates, so that any character NOT within the
					brackets (i.e. the character class) will be
					considered a match
	[a-z]		Matches an lowercase letter
	[e-x]		Matches any letter between 'e' and 'x'
	[A-Za-z]	Matches any letter
	[0-9]		Matches any digit
	[A-Za-z0-9]		Matches any alphanumeric character
	\w			Also matches an alphanumeric character
	\W			Matches an NON-alphanumeric character
	\b			will match a word boundary, use this on either
					side of the expression you're after
	'^x'		will only match lines that BEGIN with 'x'
	'x$'		will only match lines that END with 'x'
	'x{n}'	denotes that the expression 'x' should appear 'n'
					times to register a match
	'x{m,n}'	denotes that the expression 'x' should appear
					between 'm' and 'n' times to register a match


	Disjunction, |
	------------------
	'regex1 | regex2'		Allows the text to match the regex
									to the left OR the right of |


	Escape Character
	------------------
	'\[\?\]'		Allows you to escape special characters we've
						seen, so we could find the expression
						'[?]' here, even though [, ?, and ] stand
						for certain wildcards in the regex language


	Shorter Regex Overview
	----------------------
		.		Any character
		?		Zero or one
		+		One or more
		*		zero or more
		|		Disjunction (or)
		[]		Character class
		^		Beginning of line
		$		End of line
		\		Escape character
		{}		Number of Instances
		\w		[a-zA-Z0-9]
		\W		[^a-zA-Z0-9]
		\b		Word boundaries





----------------------------------------------------------------
-------- Version Control ---------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------


	----- diff ----------
	Format:		diff file1 file2
	Notes:		Tells you the difference between
						file1 and file2, including what
						lines the differences occur on

	----- patch ---------
	Format:		patch file_to_update diff_output
	Notes:		You feed the output of diff to this command
						and patch will try to update the file
	Advantage:	Only the diff output needs to be sent,
						not the entire file




	----- git ---------------------------------------------------

		-- init ----------
		Format:		git init
		Notes:		Creates a repository in the current directory

		-- status --------
		Format: 		git status
		Notes:


		-- clone ---------
		Format: 		git clone repo_location
		Notes:		Creates a local copy of central repository
							at repo_location which contains all files
							and a revision history

		-- commit --------
		Format:		git commit -m "log message"
		Notes:		Sends all changes made to the user's
						local repository with a commit log message

		-- add -----------
		Format:		git add
		Notes:		specify which files to include in next commit,
							including ANY files you have made changes
							to, NOT just new files

		-- push ----------
		Format:		git push
		Notes:		used to send all changes made to the user's
							copy of the files to the remote central
							repository

		-- pull ----------
		Format:		git pull
		Notes:  		Used to retrieve updates from central repository
							and merge them with local repository





----------------------------------------------------------------
-------- Encryption --------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------

	----- Terminology --------------
	encrypt			transforms a message into something unreadable
	plaintext		a message
	cipher			an algorithm to encode the plaintext message
	ciphertext		the unreadable message/information
	key				allows the user to revert the ciphertext back
							to plaintext
	decrypt			the act of converting back to something
							readable
	Subsitiution 	Where you replace each letter in plaintext
		ciphers			with another letter
	Shared key		This type of encryption uses the same key for
		ciphers			both encryption and decryption; the Caeser
							cipher falls under this classification
	Public key		Uses a pair of keys: a public key for
		Encryption		encryption and a private key for decryption;
						So anyone with the public key can encrypt
							plaintext into ciphertext and anyone with
							the private key can decrypt ciphertext
							into plaintext;
						So you can send people your
							public key so they can encrypt files and
							you don't have to worry that they can
							decrypt files since they don't have the
							private key;
						No private keys EVER have to be shared



	----- Translate (tr) -----------

		tr SET1 SET2

		-Used for substitution ciphers
		-Replaces each letter in SET1 with the letter specified
			in SET2
		-Can do Caeser cipher by setting SET1 as [a-z] and
			SET2 as [d-za-c], where the Caeser cipher just shifts
			letters by a specified amount
		-Can decrypt by switching SET1 and SET2


	----- gpg ----------------------


		gpg --symmetric some_file

			-Will generate some_file.gpg, which contains the
				ciphertext
			-You'll be prompted to enter a passphrase



		gpg --decrypt somefile.gpg

			-This will decrypt your file
			-You'll be prmpoed to enter your passphrase
